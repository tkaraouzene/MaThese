abstract = {A complex interplay among host, pathogen, and environmental factors is believed to contribute to the risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The lack of replication of published genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings limits the clinical utility of reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We conducted a GWAS using 467 PTB cases and 1,313 healthy controls obtained from two community-based cohorts in Korea. We evaluated the performance of PTB risk models based on different combinations of genetic and nongenetic factors and validated the results in an independent Korean population comprised of 179 PTB cases and 500 healthy controls. We demonstrated the polygenic nature of PTB and nongenetic factors such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were strongly associated with PTB risk. None of the SNPs achieved genome-wide significance; instead, we were able to replicate the associations between PTB and ten SNPs near or in the genes, CDCA7, GBE1, GADL1, SPATA16, C6orf118, KIAA1432, DMRT2, CTR9, CCDC67, and CDH13, which may play roles in the immune and inflammatory pathways. Among the replicated SNPs, an intergenic SNP, rs9365798, located downstream of the C6orf118 gene showed the most significant association under the dominant model (OR = 1.59, 95{\%} CI 1.32-1.92, P = 2.1×10-6). The performance of a risk model combining the effects of ten replicated SNPs and six nongenetic factors (i.e., age, sex, BMI, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin) were validated in the replication set (AUC = 0.80, 95{\%} CI 0.76-0.84). The strategy of combining genetic and nongenetic risk factors ultimately resulted in better risk prediction for PTB in the adult Korean population.},

abstract = {In this study, a gene coding a novel human sperm tail protein named NYD-SP28 was cloned and characterized using a complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray. Its expression was 3.5 times higher in human testis than in fetal testis, and very high in human spermatozoa. The full length of NYD-SP28 cDNA was 1798 bp and encoded a 484-amino-acid protein. Motif analysis revealed that the protein contained a cluster of phosphorylation sites, N-glycosylation sites and N-myristoylation sites. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal human testes showed that NYD-SP28 was expressed in the cytoplasm of spermatogenic cells but not in interstitial cells. The EGFP-NYD-SP28 fusion protein was also localized in the cytoplasm of transfected 7721 cells. In human spermatozoa, NYD-SP28 immunoreactivity was detected in entire sperm tail. Using the two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting technique, NYD-SP28 was found to be post-translationally modified during sperm capacitation. In conclusion, these results suggest that NYD-SP28 is a new human sperm tail protein and might play an important role during sperm capacitation.},

abstract = {Centrioles are evolutionarily conserved microtubule-based structures at the core of the animal centrosome that are essential for nucleating the axoneme of cilia. We hypothesized that centriole proteins have been under-represented in proteomic studies of the centrosome, because of the larger amount of pericentriolar material making up the centrosome. In this study, we have overcome this problem by determining the centriolar proteome of mammalian sperm cells, which have a pair of centrioles but little pericentriolar material. Mass spectrometry of sperm centrioles identifies known components of centrioles and many previously uncharacterized candidate centriole proteins. Assessment of localization of a subset of these candidates in cultured cells identified CCDC113, CCDC96, C4orf47, CCDC38, C7orf31, CCDC146, CCDC81 and CCDC116 as centrosome-associated proteins. We examined the highly conserved protein CCDC113 further and found that it is a component of centriolar satellites, is in a complex with the satellite proteins HAP1 and PCM1, and functions in primary cilium formation.},

@article{Hu2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND TG-interacting factors (TGIFs) belong to a family of TALE-homeodomain proteins including TGIF1, TGIF2 and TGIFLX/Y in human. Both TGIF1 and TGIF2 act as transcription factors repressing TGF-$\beta$ signalling. Human TGIFLX and its orthologue, Tex1 in the mouse, are X-linked genes that are only expressed in the adult testis. TGIF2 arose from TGIF1 by duplication, whereas TGIFLX arose by retrotransposition to the X-chromosome. These genes have not been characterised in any non-eutherian mammals. We therefore studied the TGIF family in the tammar wallaby (a marsupial mammal) to investigate their roles in reproduction and how and when these genes may have evolved their functions and chromosomal locations. RESULTS Both TGIF1 and TGIF2 were present in the tammar genome on autosomes but TGIFLX was absent. Tammar TGIF1 shared a similar expression pattern during embryogenesis, sexual differentiation and in adult tissues to that of TGIF1 in eutherian mammals, suggesting it has been functionally conserved. Tammar TGIF2 was ubiquitously expressed throughout early development as in the human and mouse, but in the adult, it was expressed only in the gonads and spleen, more like the expression pattern of human TGIFLX and mouse Tex1. Tammar TGIF2 mRNA was specifically detected in round and elongated spermatids. There was no mRNA detected in mature spermatozoa. TGIF2 protein was specifically located in the cytoplasm of spermatids, and in the residual body and the mid-piece of the mature sperm tail. These data suggest that tammar TGIF2 may participate in spermiogenesis, like TGIFLX does in eutherians. TGIF2 was detected for the first time in the ovary with mRNA produced in the granulosa and theca cells, suggesting it may also play a role in folliculogenesis. CONCLUSIONS The restricted and very similar expression of tammar TGIF2 to X-linked paralogues in eutherians suggests that the evolution of TGIF1, TGIF2 and TGIFLX in eutherians was accompanied by a change from ubiquitous to tissue-specific expression. The distribution and localization of TGIF2 in tammar adult gonads suggest that there has been an ultra-conserved function for the TGIF family in fertility and that TGIF2 already functioned in spermatogenesis and potentially folliculogenesis long before its retrotransposition to the X-chromosome of eutherian mammals. These results also provide further evidence that the eutherian X-chromosome has actively recruited sex and reproductive-related genes during mammalian evolution.},

abstract = {Spermatogenesis is a complex process involving an intrinsic genetic program composed of germ cell-specific and -predominant genes. In this study, we investigated the mouse Spink2 (serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 2) gene, which belongs to the SPINK family of proteins characterized by the presence of a Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor-pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor domain. We showed that recombinant mouse SPINK2 has trypsin-inhibitory activity. Distribution analyses revealed that Spink2 is transcribed strongly in the testis and weakly in the epididymis, but is not detected in other mouse tissues. Expression of Spink2 is specific to germ cells in the testis and is first evident at the pachytene spermatocyte stage. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that SPINK2 protein is present in male germ cells at all developmental stages, including in testicular spermatogenic cells, testicular sperm, and mature sperm. To elucidate the functional role of SPINK2 in vivo, we generated mutant mice with diminished levels of SPINK2 using a gene trap mutagenesis approach. Mutant male mice exhibit significantly impaired fertility; further phenotypic analyses revealed that testicular integrity is disrupted, resulting in a reduction in sperm number. Moreover, we found that testes from mutant mice exhibit abnormal spermatogenesis and germ cell apoptosis accompanied by elevated serine protease activity. Our studies thus provide the first demonstration that SPINK2 is required for maintaining normal spermatogenesis and potentially regulates serine protease-mediated apoptosis in male germ cells.},

If translated, these mRNAs can produce truncated proteins with dominant-negative or deleterious gain-of-function activities. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanism of NMD. We first cover conserved factors known to be involved in NMD in all eukaryotes. We then describe a unique protein complex that is deposited on mammalian mRNAs during splicing, which defines a stop codon as premature. Interaction between this exon-junction complex (EJC) and NMD factors assembled at the upstream stop codon triggers a series of steps that ultimately lead to mRNA decay. We discuss whether these proofreading events preferentially occur during a "pioneer" round of translation in higher and lower eukaryotes, their cellular location, and whether they can use alternative EJC factors or act independent of the EJC.},

abstract = {In mammals, sperm-oocyte fusion initiates Ca(2+) oscillations leading to a series of events called oocyte activation, which is the first stage of embryo development. Ca(2+) signaling is elicited by the delivery of an oocyte-activating factor by the sperm. A sperm-specific phospholipase C (PLCZ1) has emerged as the likely candidate to induce oocyte activation. Recently, PAWP, a sperm-born tryptophan domain-binding protein coded by WBP2NL, was proposed to serve the same purpose. Here, we studied two infertile brothers exhibiting normal sperm morphology but complete fertilization failure after intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Whole exomic sequencing evidenced a missense homozygous mutation in PLCZ1, c.1465A{\textgreater}T; p.Ile489Phe, converting Ile 489 into Phe. We showed the mutation is deleterious, leading to the absence of the protein in sperm, mislocalization of the protein when injected in mouse GV and MII oocytes, highly abnormal Ca(2+) transients and early embryonic arrest. Altogether these alterations are consistent with our patients' sperm inability to induce oocyte activation and initiate embryo development. In contrast, no deleterious variants were identified in WBP2NL and PAWP presented normal expression and localization. Overall we demonstrate in humans, the absence of PLCZ1 alone is sufficient to prevent oocyte activation irrespective of the presence of PAWP. Additionally, it is the first mutation located in the C2 domain of PLCZ1, a domain involved in targeting proteins to cell membranes. This opens the door to structure-function studies to identify the conserved amino acids of the C2 domain that regulate the targeting of PLCZ1 and its selectivity for its lipid substrate(s).},

However, the protein factors mediating meiotic telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope and the requirement of this attachment for homolog pairing and synapsis have not been determined in animals. Here we show that the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN1 specifically associates with telomeres between the leptotene and diplotene stages during meiotic prophase I. Disruption of Sun1 in mice prevents telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope, efficient homolog pairing, and synapsis formation in meiosis. Massive apoptotic events are induced in the mutant gonads, leading to the abolishment of both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. This study provides genetic evidence that SUN1-telomere interaction is essential for telomere dynamic movement and is required for efficient homologous chromosome pairing/synapsis during mammalian gametogenesis.},

abstract = {SUN domain proteins are integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane and functions in linkage of the nuclear lamina to the cytoskeleton. Moreover, SUN domain proteins seem to mediate the tethering of the centrosome to the nuclear membrane, and they are involved in telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope in meiotic cells, and in germ cell development in invertebrates. In contrast to the widely expressed SUN domain proteins in mammals, SUN1 and SUN2, which have been analysed in great detail, there is virtually nothing known about testicular SUN domain proteins. Since a hallmark of male germ cell development is the profound remodelling of the nuclear envelope, emphasized, for example, by the reshaping of the nucleus during spermiogenesis, and the biogenesis of its tightly associated acrosome, SUN domain proteins might be engaged in these processes. We have isolated a novel SUN domain protein, SPAG4L-2, that differs from SPAG4L by an N-terminal insertion of 25 amino acids. Spag4l and Spag4l-2 are exclusively expressed in testis at about equimolar amounts, and show elevated transcription during ongoing spermiogenesis coincident with the appearance of round spermatids. Molecular dissection of the protein followed by cytological and biochemical investigations revealed that SPAG4L-2 and SPAG4L are transmembrane proteins that localize to the nuclear envelope. SPAG4L/4L-2 are restricted to the apical nuclear region of round spermatids that face the acrosomic vesicle, and thus are most probably involved in linkage of the acrosomic vesicle to the spermatid nucleus, and in acrosome biogenesis.},

abstract = {Ten to fifteen percent of couples are confronted with infertility and a male factor is involved in approximately half the cases. A genetic etiology is likely in most cases yet only few genes have been formally correlated with male infertility. Homozygosity mapping was carried out on a cohort of 20 North African individuals, including 18 index cases, presenting with primary infertility resulting from impaired sperm motility caused by a mosaic of multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) including absent, short, coiled, bent, and irregular flagella. Five unrelated subjects out of 18 (28{\%}) carried a homozygous variant in DNAH1, which encodes an inner dynein heavy chain and is expressed in testis. RT-PCR, immunostaining, and electronic microscopy were carried out on samples from one of the subjects with a mutation located on a donor splice site. Neither the transcript nor the protein was observed in this individual, confirming the pathogenicity of this variant. A general axonemal disorganization including mislocalization of the microtubule doublets and loss of the inner dynein arms was observed. Although DNAH1 is also expressed in other ciliated cells, infertility was the only symptom of primary ciliary dyskinesia observed in affected subjects, suggesting that DNAH1 function in cilium is not as critical as in sperm flagellum. {\textcopyright} 2014 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {An increasing number of couples require medical assistance to achieve a pregnancy, and more than 2{\%} of the births in Western countries now result from assisted reproductive technologies. To identify genetic variants responsible for male infertility, we performed a whole-genome SNP scan on patients presenting with total globozoospermia, a primary infertility phenotype characterized by the presence of 100{\%} round acrosomeless spermatozoa in the ejaculate. This strategy allowed us to identify in most patients (15/20) a 200 kb homozygous deletion encompassing only DPY19L2, which is highly expressed in the testis. Although there was no known function for DPY19L2 in humans, previous work indicated that its ortholog in C. elegans is involved in cell polarity. In man, the DPY19L2 region has been described as a copy-number variant (CNV) found to be duplicated and heterozygously deleted in healthy individuals. We show here that the breakpoints of the deletions are located on a highly homologous 28 kb low copy repeat (LCR) sequence present on each side of DPY19L2, indicating that the identified deletions were probably produced by nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between these two regions. We demonstrate that patients with globozoospermia have a homozygous deletion of DPY19L2, thus indicating that DPY19L2 is necessary in men for sperm head elongation and acrosome formation. A molecular diagnosis can now be proposed to affected men; the presence of the deletion confirms the diagnosis of globozoospermia and assigns a poor prognosis for the success of in vitro fertilization.},

abstract = {Egg activation, which is the first step in the initiation of embryo development, involves both completion of meiosis and progression into mitotic cycles. In mammals, the fertilizing sperm delivers the activating signal, which consists of oscillations in free cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a technique that in vitro fertilization clinics use to treat a myriad of male factor infertility cases. Importantly, some patients who repeatedly fail ICSI also fail to induce egg activation and are, therefore, sterile. Here, we have found that sperm from patients who repeatedly failed ICSI were unable to induce [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in mouse eggs. We have also shown that PLC, zeta 1 (PLCZ1), the sperm protein thought to induce [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations, was localized to the equatorial region of wild-type sperm heads but was undetectable in sperm from patients who had failed ICSI. The absence of PLCZ1 in these patients was further confirmed by Western blot, although genomic sequencing failed to reveal conclusive PLCZ1 mutations. Using mouse eggs, we reproduced the failure of sperm from these patients to induce egg activation and rescued it by injection of mouse Plcz1 mRNA. Together, our results indicate that the inability of human sperm to initiate [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations leads to failure of egg activation and sterility and that abnormal PLCZ1 expression underlies this functional defect.},

abstract = {Sperm-head elongation and acrosome formation, which take place during the last stages of spermatogenesis, are essential to produce competent spermatozoa that are able to cross the oocyte zona pellucida and to achieve fertilization. During acrosome biogenesis, acrosome attachment and spreading over the nucleus are still poorly understood and to date no proteins have been described to link the acrosome to the nucleus. We recently demonstrated that a deletion of DPY19L2, a gene coding for an uncharacterized protein, was responsible for a majority of cases of type I globozoospermia, a rare cause of male infertility that is characterized by the exclusive production of round-headed acrosomeless spermatozoa. Here, using Dpy19l2 knockout mice, we describe the cellular function of the Dpy19l2 protein. We demonstrate that the protein is expressed predominantly in spermatids with a very specific localization restricted to the inner nuclear membrane facing the acrosomal vesicle. We show that the absence of Dpy19l2 leads to the destabilization of both the nuclear dense lamina (NDL) and the junction between the acroplaxome and the nuclear envelope. Consequently, the acrosome and the manchette fail to be linked to the nucleus leading to the disruption of vesicular trafficking, failure of sperm nuclear shaping and eventually to the elimination of the unbound acrosomal vesicle. Finally, we show for the first time that Dpy19l3 proteins are also located in the inner nuclear envelope, therefore implying that the Dpy19 proteins constitute a new family of structural transmembrane proteins of the nuclear envelope.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Low copy repeats (LCRs) are thought to play an important role in recent gene evolution, especially when they facilitate gene duplications. Duplicate genes are fundamental to adaptive evolution, providing substrates for the development of new or shared gene functions. Moreover, silencing of duplicate genes can have an indirect effect on adaptive evolution by causing genomic relocation of functional genes. These changes are theorized to have been a major factor in speciation. RESULTS Here we present a novel example showing functional gene relocation within a LCR. We characterize the genomic structure and gene content of eight related LCRs on human Chromosomes 7 and 12. Two members of a novel transmembrane gene family, DPY19L, were identified in these regions, along with six transcribed pseudogenes. One of these genes, DPY19L2, is found on Chromosome 12 and is not syntenic with its mouse orthologue. Instead, the human locus syntenic to mouse Dpy19l2 contains a pseudogene, DPY19L2P1. This indicates that the ancestral copy of this gene has been silenced, while the descendant copy has remained active. Thus, the functional copy of this gene has been relocated to a new genomic locus. We then describe the expansion and evolution of the DPY19L gene family from a single gene found in invertebrate animals. Ancient duplications have led to multiple homologues in different lineages, with three in fish, frogs and birds and four in mammals. CONCLUSION Our results show that the DPY19L family has expanded throughout the vertebrate lineage and has undergone recent primate-specific evolution within LCRs.},

We have developed rapid computational heuristics based on BLAST analysis to detect segmental duplications, as well as regions containing potential sequence misassignments in the human genome assemblies. RESULTS Our analysis of the June 2002 public human genome assembly revealed that 107.4 of 3,043.1 megabases (Mb) (3.53{\%}) of sequence contained segmental duplications, each with size equal or more than 5 kb and 90{\%} identity. We have also detected that 38.9 Mb (1.28{\%}) of sequence within this assembly is likely to be involved in sequence misassignment errors. Furthermore, we have identified a significant subset (199,965 of 2,327,473 or 8.6{\%}) of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the public databases that are not true SNPs but are potential paralogous sequence variants. CONCLUSION Using two distinct computational approaches, we have identified most of the sequences in the human genome that have undergone recent segmental duplications. Near-identical segmental duplications present a major challenge to the completion of the human genome sequence. Potential sequence misassignments detected in this study would require additional efforts to resolve.},

abstract = {To date, mutations in two genes, SPATA16 and DPY19L2, have been identified as responsible for a severe teratozoospermia, namely globozoospermia. The two initial descriptions of the DPY19L2 deletion lead to a very different rate of occurrence of this mutation among globospermic patients. In order to better estimate the contribution of DPY19L2 in globozoospermia, we screened a larger cohort including 64 globozoospermic patients. Twenty of the new patients were homozygous for the DPY19L2 deletion, and 7 were compound heterozygous for both this deletion and a point mutation. We also identified four additional mutated patients. The final mutation load in our cohort is 66.7{\%} (36 out of 54). Out of 36 mutated patients, 69.4{\%} are homozygous deleted, 19.4{\%} heterozygous composite and 11.1{\%} showed a homozygous point mutation. The mechanism underlying the deletion is a non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between the flanking low-copy repeats. Here, we characterized a total of nine breakpoints for the DPY19L2 NAHR-driven deletion that clustered in two recombination hotspots, both containing direct repeat elements (AluSq2 in hotspot 1, THE1B in hotspot 2). Globozoospermia can be considered as a new genomic disorder. This study confirms that DPY19L2 is the major gene responsible for globozoospermia and enlarges the spectrum of possible mutations in the gene. This is a major finding and should contribute to the development of an efficient molecular diagnosis strategy for globozoospermia.},

abstract = {Numerous new disease-gene associations have been identified by whole-exome sequencing studies in the last few years. However, many cases remain unsolved due to the sheer number of candidate variants remaining after common filtering strategies such as removing low quality and common variants and those deemed unlikely to be pathogenic. The observation that each of our genomes contains about 100 genuine loss-of-function variants makes identification of the causative mutation problematic when using these strategies alone. We propose using the wealth of genotype to phenotype data that already exists from model organism studies to assess the potential impact of these exome variants. Here, we introduce PHenotypic Interpretation of Variants in Exomes (PHIVE), an algorithm that integrates the calculation of phenotype similarity between human diseases and genetically modified mouse models with evaluation of the variants according to allele frequency, pathogenicity, and mode of inheritance approaches in our Exomiser tool. Large-scale validation of PHIVE analysis using 100,000 exomes containing known mutations demonstrated a substantial improvement (up to 54.1-fold) over purely variant-based (frequency and pathogenicity) methods with the correct gene recalled as the top hit in up to 83{\%} of samples, corresponding to an area under the ROC curve of {\textgreater}95{\%}. We conclude that incorporation of phenotype data can play a vital role in translational bioinformatics and propose that exome sequencing projects should systematically capture clinical phenotypes to take advantage of the strategy presented here.},

Personal diploid human genome sequences have been generated, and each has contributed to our better understanding of variation in the human genome. We have consequently begun to appreciate the vastness of individual genetic variation from single nucleotide to structural variants. Translation of genome-scale variation into medically useful information is, however, in its infancy. This review summarizes the initial steps undertaken in clinical implementation of personal genome information, and describes the application of whole-genome and exome sequencing to identify the cause of genetic diseases and to suggest adjuvant therapies. Better analysis tools and a deeper understanding of the biology of our genome are necessary in order to decipher, interpret, and optimize clinical utility of what the variation in the human genome can teach us. Personal genome sequencing may eventually become an instrument of common medical practice, providing information that assists in the formulation of a differential diagnosis.

This mutation was distinct from previously reported DNAH1 mutations associated with MMAF and only affected the East Asian group. Furthermore, the variant DNAH1 protein could not be detected in spermatozoa by Western blot or immunofluorescence staining although DNAH1 mRNA was expressed in the spermatozoa. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analysis showed the anomalies in sperm flagella morphology and ultrastructure in patients carrying this genetic variant.

abstract = {STUDY QUESTION Can whole-exome sequencing (WES) of patients with multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) identify causal mutations in new genes or mutations in the previously identified dynein axonemal heavy chain 1 (DNAH1) gene? SUMMARY ANSWER WES for six families with men affected by MMAF syndrome allowed the identification of DNAH1 mutations in four affected men distributed in two out of the six families but no new candidate genes were identified. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Mutations in DNAH1, an axonemal inner dynein arm heavy chain gene, have been shown to be responsible for male infertility due to a characteristic form of asthenozoospermia called MMAF, defined by the presence in the ejaculate of spermatozoa with a mosaic of flagellar abnormalities including absent, coiled, bent, angulated, irregular and short flagella. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This was a retrospective genetics study of patients presenting a MMAF phenotype. Patients were recruited in Iran and Italy between 2008 and 2015. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS WES was performed for a total of 10 subjects. All identified variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Two additional affected family members were analyzed by direct Sanger sequencing. To establish the prevalence of the DNAH1 mutation identified in an Iranian family, we carried out targeted sequencing on 38 additional MMAF patients of the same geographical origin. RT-PCR and immunochemistry were performed on sperm samples to assess the effect of the identified mutation on RNA and protein. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE WES in six families identified a causal mutations in two families. Two additional affected family members were confirmed to hold the same homozygous mutation as their sibling. In total, DNAH1 mutations were identified in 5 out of 12 analyzed subjects (41.7{\%}). If we only include index cases, we detected two mutated subjects out of six (33{\%}) tested MMAF individuals. Furthermore we sequenced one DNAH1 exon found to be mutated (c.8626-1G {\textgreater} A) in an Iranian family in an additional 38 MMAF patients from Iran. One of these patients carried the variant confirming that this variant is relatively frequent in the Iranian population. The effect of the c.8626-1G {\textgreater} A variant was confirmed by RT-PCR and immunochemistry as no RNA or protein could be observed in sperm from the affected men. LARGE SCALE DATA N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION WES allows the amplification of 80-90{\%} of all coding exons. It is possible that some DNAH1 exons may not have been sequenced and that we may have missed some additional mutations. Also, WES cannot identify deep intronic mutations and it is not efficient for detection of large genomic events (deletions, insertions, inversions). We did not identify any causal mutations in DNAH1 or in other candidate genes in four out of the six tested families. This indicates that the technique and/or the analysis of our data can be improved to increase the diagnosis efficiency. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Our findings confirm that DNAH1 is one of the main genes involved in MMAF syndrome. It is a large gene with 78 exons making it challenging and expensive to sequence using the traditional Sanger sequencing methods. We show that WES sequencing is good alternative to Sanger sequencing to reach a genetic diagnosis in patients with severe male infertility phenotypes.

@article{Coutton2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Male infertility affects {\textgreater}20 million men worldwide and represents a major health concern. Although multifactorial, male infertility has a strong genetic basis which has so far not been extensively studied. Recent studies of consanguineous families and of small cohorts of phenotypically homogeneous patients have however allowed the identification of a number of autosomal recessive causes of teratozoospermia. Homozygous mutations of aurora kinase C (AURKC) were first described to be responsible for most cases of macrozoospermia. Other genes defects have later been identified in spermatogenesis associated 16 (SPATA16) and dpy-19-like 2 (DPY19L2) in patients with globozoospermia and more recently in dynein, axonemal, heavy chain 1 (DNAH1) in a heterogeneous group of patients presenting with flagellar abnormalities previously described as dysplasia of the fibrous sheath or short/stump tail syndromes, which we propose to call multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF). METHODS A comprehensive review of the scientific literature available in PubMed/Medline was conducted for studies on human genetics, experimental models and physiopathology related to teratozoospermia in particular globozoospermia, large headed spermatozoa and flagellar abnormalities. The search included all articles with an English abstract available online before September 2014. RESULTS Molecular studies of numerous unrelated patients with globozoospermia and large-headed spermatozoa confirmed that mutations in DPY19L2 and AURKC are mainly responsible for their respective pathological phenotype. In globozoospermia, the deletion of the totality of the DPY19L2 gene represents ∼ 81{\%} of the pathological alleles but point mutations affecting the protein function have also been described. In macrozoospermia only two recurrent mutations were identified in AURKC, accounting for almost all the pathological alleles, raising the possibility of a putative positive selection of heterozygous individuals. The recent identification of DNAH1 mutations in a proportion of patients with MMAF is promising but emphasizes that this phenotype is genetically heterogeneous. Moreover, the identification of mutations in a dynein strengthens the emerging point of view that MMAF may be a phenotypic variation of the classical forms of primary ciliary dyskinesia. Based on data from human and animal models, the MMAF phenotype seems to be favored by defects directly or indirectly affecting the central pair of axonemal microtubules of the sperm flagella. CONCLUSIONS The studies described here provide valuable information regarding the genetic and molecular defects causing infertility, to improve our understanding of the physiopathology of teratozoospermia while giving a detailed characterization of specific features of spermatogenesis. Furthermore, these findings have a significant influence on the diagnostic strategy for teratozoospermic patients allowing the clinician to provide the patient with informed genetic counseling, to adopt the best course of treatment and to develop personalized medicine directly targeting the defective gene products.},

abstract = {AbstractGenetic mechanisms are implicated in some cases of male infertility. Recently, it was demonstrated that male mice lacking the gene for RAD21L exhibited azoospermia caused by meiotic arrest. Mouse RAD21L is a functionally relevant meiotic $\alpha$-kleisin that is essential for male fertility. Therefore, we hypothesized that RAD21L mutations or polymorphisms may be associated with male infertility, especially azoospermia secondary to meiotic arrest. To determine if RAD21L defects are associated with azoospermia in groups of patients with meiotic arrest, we performed direct sequencing of the RAD21L coding regions in 38 Japanese patients with meiotic arrest and in 200 normal controls. Three coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP1–SNP3) were detected in the meiotic arrest patient group. Sertoli cell-only syndrome is considered a common cause of non-obstructive azoospermia. For comparison, the RAD21L coding regions in which SNP1–SNP3 were detected were sequenced in 140 patients with Sertoli cell-only synd...},

@article{Amdani2013,
abstract = {Mounting scientific and clinical evidence supports the key role played by phospholipase C zeta (PLC$\zeta$), a sperm-specific protein, in the activation of oocytes following fertilisation. Lacking a pleckstrin homology domain, PLC$\zeta$ remains the smallest known mammalian PLC and was first identified in 2002. Since then, PLC$\zeta$ has been the target for a multitude of studies in both mammalian and non-mammalian species focused upon its fundamental biochemical activity and crucial role as the mediator of oocyte activation. The earliest event subsequent to gamete fusion is the onset of a series of intracellular calcium oscillations within the oocyte, which are known to modulate cortical granule exocytosis, release meiotic arrest, regulate gene expression, recruit maternal mRNA, and initiate embryogenesis. Collectively these processes are known as 'oocyte activation' and together, represent a fundamental mechanism for early embryonic development. Evidence suggests that these processes are initiated and controlled by calcium release from ooplasmic sources in response to PLC$\zeta$ activity via the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) pathway. While the biochemical action of PLC$\zeta$ has been extensively studied, especially in relation to the EF-hands, X-Y linker, and C2 domain, all of which play critical roles for in vivo activity, there are still key gaps in our knowledge, particularly in terms of regulation and interaction with other proteins within the oocyte. Moreover, increasing clinical evidence has revealed a strong correlation between certain types of male infertility and the aberrant expression, localisation, structure and function of PLC$\zeta$ in human sperm, particularly in cases of recurrent intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) failure, globozoospermia, and oocyte activation deficiency (OAD). In addition, two heterozygous substitution mutations have been identified in the coding sequence of PLC$\zeta$ in one particular patient causing disruption to the catalytic X and Y domains and resulting in infertility. Although, such cases can be treated via the use of artificial oocyte activators (AOAs) such as calcium ionophores, significant concern remains over the use of such chemical agents, largely due to the fact that calcium release manifests as a single transient, rather than a series of oscillations as observed during normal fertilisation. Current interest in PLC$\zeta$ is thus to develop a series of prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches which could first identify male patients that are deficient in PLC$\zeta$ and then rescue oocyte activation ability via assisted reproductive technology (ART) and a pure, functionally-active, recombinant human PLC$\zeta$ protein. While significant progress has been made in such areas over recent years, there is a clear need to translate scientific findings to clinical settings in order to maximise successful outcome for patients.},

Sperm morphology was evaluated from Papanicolaou-stained smears, and the classification of abnormal sperm forms was made according to the guidelines of the World Health Organization. RESULTS The percentage of headless spermatozoa was 9.0{\%} +/- 8.8 in subfertile and 2.7{\%} +/- 3.1 in fertile men. Headless spermatozoa existed in semen specimens from 90{\%} of subfertile and 70{\%} of fertile men. Of subfertile men, 23.4{\%} had headless spermatozoa at a higher percentage than the highest normal limit found in sperm smears from fertile men. CONCLUSION In some cases of subfertile men with a high percentage of headless spermatozoa, their infertility can be attributed to the cause of this morphological abnormality. Moreover, tails but not heads were found in semen specimens from subfertile and fertile men.},

abstract = {Three patients with primary sterility in whom the majority of spermatozoa lacked a normally implanted head are presented. A small cephalic knob was evident in most of them by routine colorimetric techniques, and the Feulgen reaction failed to show any deoxyribose nucleic acid. The morphologic features of the tails was normal. Few loose sperm heads were observed in the ejaculates. Even though motility was decreased, there were numerous acephalic sperms with different degrees of forward motility. Electron microscopy showed a well-organized structure of the centrioles and connecting piece, which were located in the neck region within a small cytoplasmic mass, but no chromatin was detected in any case. Studies on immature spermatids present in semen evidenced an independent anomalous development of heads and tails and suggested that they became separated at the end of spermatid maturation. This anomaly, of probable genetic origin, is interpreted to be due either to an alteration in the mechanism of migration and positioning of the tail on the caudal pole of the nucleus or to an interference with the formation of the implantation fossa of the head, which normally accommodates the connecting piece.},

abstract = {AIM To study polyethylenimine (PEI)-mediated in vivo gene transfection into testis cells and preliminary functional research of spermatogenic cell-specific gene NYD-SP12 using this method. METHODS PEI/DNA complexes were introduced into the seminiferous tubules of mouse testes using intratesticular injection. Transfection efficiency and speciality were analyzed on the third day of transfection with fluorescent microscopy and hematoxylin staining. The long-lasting expression of the GFP-NYD-SP12 fusion protein and its subcellular localization in spermatogenic cells at different stages were analyzed with fluorescent microscopy and propidium iodide staining. RESULTS With the mediation of PEI, the GFP-NYD-SP12 fusion gene was efficiently transferred and expressed in the germ cells (especially in primary spermatocytes). Transfection into Sertoli cells was not observed. The subcellular localization of the GFP-NYD-SP2 fusion protein showed dynamic shifts in spermatogenic cells at different stages during spermatogenesis. CONCLUSION PEI can efficiently mediate gene transfer into spermatocytes. Thus, it might be useful for the functional research of spermatogenic-cell specific genes such as the NYD-SP12 gene. In our study, the NYD-SP12 protein was visualized and was involved in the formation of acrosome during spermatogenesis. Our research will continue into the detailed function of NYD-SP12 in spermatocytes.},

It originates from a disturbed spermiogenesis, which is expected to be induced by a genetic factor. Several family cases and recessive mouse models with the same phenotype support this expectation. In this study, we present a consanguineous family with three affected brothers, in whom we have identified a homozygous mutation in the spermatogenesis-specific gene SPATA16. This is the first example of a nonsyndromic male infertility condition in humans caused by an autosomal gene defect, and it could also mean that the identification of other partners like SPATA16 could elucidate acrosome formation.},

abstract = {Globozoospermia is a rare (incidence {\textless}0.1{\%}) but severe disorder in male infertility. Total globozoospermia is diagnosed by the presence of 100{\%} round-headed spermatozoa lacking an acrosome. It is still unclear whether patients whose ejaculate contains both normal and globozoospermic cells (partial globozoospermia) suffer from a variation of the same syndrome. Apart from the fact that affected males suffer from reduced fertility or even infertility, no other physical characteristics can be associated with the syndrome. ICSI is a treatment option for these patients, although low fertilization rates after ICSI show a reduced ability to activate the oocyte. In globozoospermic cells, the use of acrosome markers has demonstrated an absent or severely malformed acrosome. Chromatin compaction appears to be disturbed but is not consistently over- or undercondensed. In some cases, an increased number of cells with DNA fragmentation have been observed. The analysis of the cytogenetic composition revealed an increased aneuploidy rate in some cases. Nonetheless, no increased number of spontaneous abortions or congenital defects has been reported in pregnancies conceived after ICSI. The pathogenesis of globozoospermia most probably originates in spermiogenesis, more specifically in acrosome formation and sperm head elongation. In several knockout mouse models, a phenotype similar to that in humans was found. Together with the occurrence of affected siblings, these findings indicate a genetic origin, which makes globozoospermia a good candidate for genetic analysis. More research is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of human globozoospermia to further understand globozoospermia as well as (abnormalities in) spermiogenesis and spermatogenesis in general.},

abstract = {The assessment of the percentage of spermatozoa having an 'ideal' morphology using so-called strict method is the method recommended in the latest edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory manual for semen analysis. This recommendation is a result of the statistical association between 'ideal' sperm morphology and fertility, and of the current general belief that sperm morphology assessment should be used primarily as a fertility tool. The notion of an 'ideal' sperm morphology has persisted despite the very low percentage of such spermatozoa in the semen of fertile men, a subject of intense controversy. The detailed categorization of each abnormal spermatozoon has thus, for a long time, been considered optional and partially redundant, an idea which is reflected in the earlier editions of the WHO manual. However, several recent studies have shown the importance of carefully assessing abnormal sperm morphology for use in the diagnosis of infertility, to determine fertility prognosis, and for basic or public health studies. One approach, which combines videomicroscopy and computer vision, and is the only approach able to assess the continuum of sperm biometrics, has been used successfully in several recent clinical, basic and toxicology studies. In summary, the visual assessment of detailed sperm morphology-including the categorization of anomalies allowing arithmetically derived indices of teratozoospermia-and the more modern computer-based approaches, although often considered to be redundant, are in fact complementary. The choice of the most appropriate method depends on the field of investigation (clinical, research, toxicology) and the problem being addressed. Each approach has advantages as well as certain limitations, which will be discussed briefly herein.},

abstract = {Chromosome aneuploidy is a major cause of pregnancy loss, abnormal pregnancy and live births following both natural conception and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and increases exponentially with maternal age in the decade preceding the menopause. Molecular genetic analysis has shown that these are predominantly maternal in origin and trisomies most frequently occur through errors in the first meiotic division. Analysis of chromosome copy number in the three products of female meiosis, the first and second polar bodies and the corresponding zygote by microarray comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH), in women of advanced maternal age undergoing IVF, has recently revealed a pattern of frequent multiple meiotic errors, caused by premature predivision of sister chromatids in meiosis I and a high incidence of errors in meiosis II. This pattern is similar to those observed in various mouse models which implicate the gradual depletion of cohesins, which are essential for cohesion of sister chromatids, as the primary cause of age related aneuploidy in female meiosis. However, defects in other aspects of meiosis including the formation and stabilisation of chiasmata and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) may also contribute. The challenge remains to explain the molecular basis of ‘physiological' rather than ‘chronological' female ageing and the contribution of multifactorial causes from the fetal to adult ovary.

abstract = {In a group of normospermic donors exhibiting hamster oocyte penetration scores of 0-100{\%}, multiple regression analysis indicated that only 20{\%} of the variation in fertilizing potential could be explained by differences in the movement characteristics of the spermatozoa following incubation in vitro. When the movement characteristics of the spermatozoa in semen were considered this figure was reduced to 6.8{\%} as a result of significant differences in the motility patterns exhibited by the seminal and post-incubation sperm populations. A much closer relationship was observed between the movement characteristics of human spermatozoa in semen and their ability to penetrate cervical mucus. When differences in motile sperm densities were taken into account, 76{\%} of the variation in cervical mucus penetration could be accounted for by the existence of linear correlations with certain aspects of sperm movement (multiple R = 0.874). Of the various attributes of sperm motility measured (linear velocity of progression, frequency of rotation, amplitude of sperm head displacement, {\%} rolling and {\%} yawing), a failure to exhibit an adequate amplitude of lateral sperm head displacement was consistently found to be the most significant factor determining the success of sperm-cervical mucus interaction (R2 = 0.53).},

OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to distinguish the 46,XX male syndrome from the more frequent 47,XXY-Klinefelter syndrome in regard to clinical, hormonal, and epigenetic features. DESIGN This was a case-control study. SETTING The study was conducted at a university-based reproductive medicine and andrology institution. PATIENTS Eleven SRY-positive 46,XX males were compared with age-matched controls: 101 47,XXY Klinefelter patients, 78 healthy men, and 157 healthy women [latter all heterozygous for androgen receptor (AR) alleles]. INTERVENTIONS There were no interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES There was a comparison of phenotype, endocrine profiles, and X-chromosomal inactivation patterns of AR alleles. RESULTS The 46,XX males were significantly smaller than Klinefelter patients or healthy men, resembling female controls in height and weight. The incidence of maldescended testes was significantly higher than that in Klinefelter patients and controls. Gynecomastia was more frequent in comparison with controls, whereas there was a nonsignificant trend in comparison with Klinefelter patients. All XX males were infertile and most were hypogonadal. The inactivation patterns of AR alleles in XX males were significantly more skewed than in Klinefelter patients and women. Seven of 10 heterozygous XX male patients displayed an extreme skewing of more than 80{\%} with no preference toward the shorter or longer AR allele. The length of the AR CAG repeat polymorphism was positively related to traits of hypogonadism. CONCLUSIONS XX males are distinctly different from Klinefelter patients in terms of clinical and epigenetic features. Nonrandom X chromosome inactivation ratios are common in XX males, possibly due to the translocated SRY gene. The existence of a Y-chromosomal, growth-related gene is discussed.},

Defects in any of these processes can result in infertility, and in some cases these can be genetic in cause.

Two of these contain the genes encoding the RNA binding proteins RBM and DAZ, suggesting that the control of RNA metabolism is likely to be an important control point for human spermatogenesis. A similar analysis in mice has shown that at least two regions of the mouse Y chromosome are essential for spermatogenesis. Both genetic and reverse genetic approaches have been used to identify mouse autosomal genes required for spermatogenesis. These studies have shown that genes in a number of different pathways are essential for normal spermatogenesis, and also provide putative models of human infertility.},

The syndrome has been known since 1942, and many reports of different diseases associated with KS have been reported since that, but a more systematic knowledge about the long-term outcome was not described until the last decade, where nation-wide epidemiological studies were reported from Britain and Denmark. We here review the epidemiological data from two cohorts of patients with KS in Denmark and Britain, showing a significant increase in both mortality and morbidity from a variety of different causes. Mortality was increased by 50{\%} (SMR 1.5 or HR 1.4) corresponding to a median loss of approximately 2 years. The risk of being admitted to hospital with any diagnosis was increased by 70{\%}. The underlying reason for the poorer health in KS may be caused by interaction of genetic, hormonal and socio-economic factors. CONCLUSION Both morbidity and mortality are significantly increased in Klinefelter syndrome with a 50{\%} increase in mortality risk and a 70{\%} increase in risk of being admitted to hospital.},

The karyotypes of 3208 patients [2196 men (68.4{\%}), 1012 (31.6{\%}) women] included in ICSI programmes over a 3-year period in France were collected. A total of 183 aberrant karyotypes was diagnosed, corresponding to an abnormality frequency of 6.1{\%} (134/2196) for men and 4.84{\%} (49/1012) for women. The following frequencies of abnormalities were observed respectively for men and women: 1.23{\%} (n = 27) and 0.69{\%} (n = 7) for reciprocal translocations, 0.82{\%} (n = 18) and 0.69{\%} (n = 7) for Robertsonian translocations, 0.13{\%} (n = 3) and 0.69{\%} (n = 7) for inversions, 3.32{\%} (n = 73) and 2.77{\%} (n = 28) for numerical sex chromosome aberrations, and 0.59{\%} (n = 13) and 0{\%} for other structural aberrations. Among the male patients of this latter group, 0.40{\%} (n = 9) had a Y chromosome abnormality. Among the male patients with numerical sex chromosome abnormalities, 2.23{\%} (n = 49) were 47,XXY, 0.32{\%} (n = 7) were 47,XYY, and 0.77{\%} (n = 17) had a mosaicism for numerical sex chromosome anomalies. All the female patients with sex chromosome abnormalities (2.77{\%}, n = 28) had mosaicism for numerical sex chromosome anomalies. Even if these cases-the significance of which was sometimes questioned-were disregarded in the analysis, 2.08{\%} (21/1012) of abnormal karyotypes remained in women. An overall increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations was found, and this confirmed that in some cases of poor reproductive outcome there may be a contribution of maternal chromosome aberrations. Indeed, the existence of a chromosome abnormality in the female partner was associated with the group of infertile men in which there was no apparent cause of infertility.},

abstract = {A combination of exogenous contractile forces generated by a stack of F-actin-containing hoops embracing the apical region of the elongating spermatid nucleus and an endogenous modulating mechanism dependent on the spermatid-containing acrosome-acroplaxome-manchette complex may play a cooperative role in the shaping of the spermatid head. In addition, the manchette is a key element in the transport of vesicles and macromolecules to the centrosome and developing spermatid tails as well as in nucleocytoplasmic transport. The proposed model of spermatid head shaping is based on: 1) currently known structural and molecular components of the F-actin hoops, the main cytoskeletal element of the Sertoli cell ectoplasmic specializations; 2) the molecular features of acrosome biogenesis; 3) the assembly of a subacrosomal cytoskeletal plate called the acroplaxome; and 4) the spatial relationship of the acrosome-acroplaxome complex with the manchette, a transient microtubular/actin-containing structure. During acrosome biogenesis, the acroplaxome becomes the nucleation site to which Golgi-derived proacrosomal vescicles tether and fuse. The acroplaxome has at least two functions: it anchors the developing acrosome to the elongating spermatid head. It may also provide a mechanical scaffolding plate during the shaping of the spermatid nucleus. The plate is stabilized by a marginal ring with junctional complex characteristics, adjusting to exogenous clutching forces generated by the stack of Sertoli cell F-actin-containing hoops applied to the elongating spermatid head. A tubulobulbar complex, formed by cytoplasmic processes protruding from the elongating spermatid head extending into the adjacent Sertoli cell, is located at the concave side of the spermatid head. The tubulobulbar complex might provide stabilizing conditions, together with the actin-afadin-nectin-2/nectin-3 adhesion unit, to enable sustained and balanced clutching exogenous forces applied during the elongation of the spermatid head.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Numerous studies have reported CFTR mutations in CBAVD (congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens) patients, but their results are not completely consistent. Here, we present a systemic review and meta-analysis with emphasis on clarifying further the genetic association of CFTR mutations with CBAVD. METHODS We searched the MEDLINE database until March, 2011 for eligible articles reporting CFTR mutations in CBAVD. Relevant data from each included study were abstracted by two independent reviewers. The overall frequency of CFTR mutations in CBAVD and the odds ratio (OR) for common specific alleles were pooled under random-effect or fixed-effect model as appropriate. Subgroup analysis was performed by ethnicity, and potential heterogeneity and bias were both assessed. RESULTS Among CBAVD patients, 78{\%} had at least one CFTR mutation, 46{\%} having two and 28{\%} only one. Moreover, the common heterozygous F508del/5T and F508del/R117H were observed in 17 and 4{\%} of CBAVD cases respectively, and the allele frequency in CBAVD was 17{\%} for F508del, 25{\%} for 5T and 3{\%} for R117H. Subgroup analysis indicated an increased frequency of cases with two mutations in Caucasian patients than in Non-Caucasian (68 versus 50{\%}, P= 0.012), but no differences for cases with at least one mutation (88 versus 77{\%}, P= 0.163) or with only one mutation (17 versus 25{\%}, P= 0.115). Caucasian patients had higher F508del frequency, but lower 5T frequency, than Non-Caucasian (22 versus 8{\%}, P= 0.001; 20 versus 31{\%}, P= 0.009). Summary OR was 9.25 for 5T [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 7.07-12.11, P= 0.000], with moderate heterogeneity (I(2)= 49.20{\%}, P= 0.019) and evident bias (Egger's test, P= 0.005), and it was 19.43 for 5T/(TG)12{\_}13 (95{\%} CI 10.48-30.03, P= 0.000) without any evidence of heterogeneity (I(2)= 0.1{\%}, P= 0.391) and bias (Egger's test, P= 0.160). The OR for 5T/(TG)12{\_}13 was significantly higher than that for 5T allele (P= 0.000). CONCLUSIONS In summary, our results demonstrate a high frequency of CFTR mutations in CBAVD patients, and these exhibit evident ethnic differences. In addition, 5T allele and 5T/(TG)12{\_}13 may contribute to the increased risk for CBAVD, with the 5T penetrance probably being modulated by adjacent (TG)12{\_}13.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Sperm donors represent an appropriate population for evaluating the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in phenotypically normal and fertile adult males. METHODS A large multicentric retrospective study was made within the French CECOS (Centre d'Etude et de Conservation des ufs et du Sperme) for collecting cytogenetic, biological and familial data in sperm donors over a 25-year period. RESULTS As a whole, 10,202 karyotypes have been recorded. Thirty-eight karyotype aberrations (0.37{\%}) have been diagnosed including 21 balanced chromosomal rearrangements (0.2{\%}). These results are in agreement with those obtained in most large-scale studies performed in unselected newborns. Semen parameters were known for all men carrying an abnormal karyotype and showed normal sperm counts, suggesting that these types of chromosomal aberrations have no or poor consequences on spermatogenesis. Available familial data did not reveal any particular history of malformations, mental retardation or fetal losses. CONCLUSION This study is the first large-scale cytogenetic study made in normal and fertile males and shows that the frequency of chromosomal aberrations is not influenced by a previous normal fertility or by an uneventful familial history when compared to that found at birth.},

abstract = {Objective: To illustrate the necessity for an enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of male factor infertility, to present a comprehensive synopsis of these genetic elements, and to review techniques being utilized to produce new insights in fertility research. Background: Male factor infertility is a complex disorder that affects a large sector of the population; however, many of its etiologies are unknown. By elucidating the underlying genetic basis of infertile phenotypes, it may be possible to discover the causes of infertility and determine effective treatments for patients. Method(s): The PubMed database was consulted for the most relevant papers published in the last 3 years pertaining to male factor infertility using the keywords "genetics" and "male infertility.". Result(s): Advances have been made in the characterization of the roles of specific genes, but further research is necessary before these results can be used as guidelines for diagnosing and treating male factor infertility. The accurate transmission of epigenetic information also has considerable influence on fertility in males and on the fertility of their offspring. Conclusion(s): Analysis of the genetic factors that impact male factor infertility will provide valuable insights into the creation of targeted treatments for patients and the determination of the causes of idiopathic infertility. Novel technologies that analyze the influence of genetics from a global perspective may lead to further developments in the understanding of the etiology of male factor infertility through the identification of specific infertile phenotype signatures. ?? 2010 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.},

abstract = {Spermatogenesis involves the aggregated action of up to 2300 genes, any of which, could, potentially, provide targets for diagnostic tests of male factor infertility. Contrary to the previously proposed common variant hypothesis for common diseases such as male infertility, genome-wide association studies and targeted gene sequencing in cohorts of infertile men have identified only a few gene polymorphisms that are associated with male infertility. Unfortunately, the search for genetic variants associated with male infertility is further hampered by the lack of viable animal models of human spermatogenesis, difficulty in robustly phenotyping infertile men and the complexity of pedigree studies in male factor infertility. In this review, we describe basic genetic principles involved in understanding the genetic basis of male infertility and examine the utility and proper clinical use of the proven genetic assays of male factor infertility, specifically Y chromosome microdeletions, chromosomal translocations, karyotype, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutation analysis and sperm genetic tests. Unfortunately, these tests are only able to diagnose the cause of about 20{\%} of male factor infertility. The remainder of the review will be devoted to examining novel tests and diagnostic tools that have the potential to explain the other 80{\%} of male factor infertility that is currently classified as idiopathic. Those tests include epigenetic analysis of the spermatozoa and the evaluation of rare genetic variants and copy number variations in patients. Success in advancing to the implementation of such areas is not only dependent on technological advances in the laboratory, but also improved phenotyping in the clinic.},

abstract = {A genetic origin is estimated in 30{\%} of infertile men with the common phenotypes of oligo- or azoospermia, but the pathogenesis of spermatogenic failure remains frequently obscure. To determine the involvement of Copy Number Variants (CNVs) in the origin of male infertility, patients with idiopathic severe oligozoospermia (N = 89), Sertoli-cell-only syndrome (SCOS, N = 37)) and controls with normozoospermia (N = 100) were analysed by array-CGH using the 244A/400K array sets (Agilent Technologies). The mean number of CNVs and the amount of DNA gain/loss were comparable between all groups. Ten recurring CNVs were only found in patients with severe oligozoospermia, three only in SCOS and one CNV in both groups with spermatogenic failure but not in normozoospermic men. Sex-chromosomal, mostly private CNVs were significantly overrepresented in patients with SCOS. CNVs found several times in all groups were analysed in a case-control design and four additional candidate genes and two regions without known genes were associated with SCOS (P{\textless}1×10(-3)). In conclusion, by applying array-CGH to study male infertility for the first time, we provide a number of candidate genes possibly causing or being risk factors for the men's spermatogenic failure. The recurring, patient-specific and private, sex-chromosomal CNVs as well as those associated with SCOS are candidates for further, larger case-control and re-sequencing studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Semen quality is taken as a surrogate measure of male fecundity in clinical andrology, male fertility, reproductive toxicology, epidemiology and pregnancy risk assessments. Reference intervals for values of semen parameters from a fertile population could provide data from which prognosis of fertility or diagnosis of infertility can be extrapolated. METHODS Semen samples from over 4500 men in 14 countries on four continents were obtained from retrospective and prospective analyses on fertile men, men of unknown fertility status and men selected as normozoospermic. Men whose partners had a time-to-pregnancy (TTP) of {\textless} or =12 months were chosen as individuals to provide reference distributions for semen parameters. Distributions were also generated for a population assumed to represent the general population. RESULTS The following one-sided lower reference limits, the fifth centiles (with 95th percent confidence intervals), were generated from men whose partners had TTP {\textless} or = 12 months: semen volume, 1.5 ml (1.4-1.7); total sperm number, 39 million per ejaculate (33-46); sperm concentration, 15 million per ml (12-16); vitality, 58{\%} live (55-63); progressive motility, 32{\%} (31-34); total (progressive + non-progressive) motility, 40{\%} (38-42); morphologically normal forms, 4.0{\%} (3.0-4.0). Semen quality of the reference population was superior to that of the men from the general population and normozoospermic men. CONCLUSIONS The data represent sound reference distributions of semen characteristics of fertile men in a number of countries. They provide an appropriate tool in conjunction with clinical data to evaluate a patient's semen quality and prospects for fertility.},

abstract = {The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) project, available at http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org, provides a structured, comprehensive and well-defined set of 10,088 classes (terms) describing human phenotypic abnormalities and 13,326 subclass relations between the HPO classes. In addition we have developed logical definitions for 46{\%} of all HPO classes using terms from ontologies for anatomy, cell types, function, embryology, pathology and other domains. This allows interoperability with several resources, especially those containing phenotype information on model organisms such as mouse and zebrafish. Here we describe the updated HPO database, which provides annotations of 7,278 human hereditary syndromes listed in OMIM, Orphanet and DECIPHER to classes of the HPO. Various meta-attributes such as frequency, references and negations are associated with each annotation. Several large-scale projects worldwide utilize the HPO for describing phenotype information in their datasets. We have therefore generated equivalence mappings to other phenotype vocabularies such as LDDB, Orphanet, MedDRA, UMLS and phenoDB, allowing integration of existing datasets and interoperability with multiple biomedical resources. We have created various ways to access the HPO database content using flat files, a MySQL database, and Web-based tools. All data and documentation on the HPO project can be found online.},

abstract = {Copy number variation (CNV) in the genome is a complex phenomenon, and not completely understood. We have developed a method, CNVnator, for CNV discovery and genotyping from read-depth (RD) analysis of personal genome sequencing. Our method is based on combining the established mean-shift approach with additional refinements (multiple-bandwidth partitioning and GC correction) to broaden the range of discovered CNVs. We calibrated CNVnator using the extensive validation performed by the 1000 Genomes Project. Because of this, we could use CNVnator for CNV discovery and genotyping in a population and characterization of atypical CNVs, such as de novo and multi-allelic events. Overall, for CNVs accessible by RD, CNVnator has high sensitivity (86{\%}-96{\%}), low false-discovery rate (3{\%}-20{\%}), high genotyping accuracy (93{\%}-95{\%}), and high resolution in breakpoint discovery ({\textless}200 bp in 90{\%} of cases with high sequencing coverage). Furthermore, CNVnator is complementary in a straightforward way to split-read and read-pair approaches: It misses CNVs created by retrotransposable elements, but more than half of the validated CNVs that it identifies are not detected by split-read or read-pair. By genotyping CNVs in the CEPH, Yoruba, and Chinese-Japanese populations, we estimated that at least 11{\%} of all CNV loci involve complex, multi-allelic events, a considerably higher estimate than reported earlier. Moreover, among these events, we observed cases with allele distribution strongly deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, possibly implying selection on certain complex loci. Finally, by combining discovery and genotyping, we identified six potential de novo CNVs in two family trios.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

Overall, we fine-mapped more than 1000 SVs and documented that the number of SVs among humans is much larger than initially hypothesized; many of the SVs potentially affect gene function. The breakpoint junction sequences of more than 200 SVs were determined with a novel pooling strategy and computational analysis. Our analysis provided insights into the mechanisms of SV formation in humans.},

abstract = {As next-generation sequencing projects generate massive genome-wide sequence variation data, bioinformatics tools are being developed to provide computational predictions on the functional effects of sequence variations and narrow down the search of casual variants for disease phenotypes. Different classes of sequence variations at the nucleotide level are involved in human diseases, including substitutions, insertions, deletions, frameshifts, and non-sense mutations. Frameshifts and non-sense mutations are likely to cause a negative effect on protein function. Existing prediction tools primarily focus on studying the deleterious effects of single amino acid substitutions through examining amino acid conservation at the position of interest among related sequences, an approach that is not directly applicable to insertions or deletions. Here, we introduce a versatile alignment-based score as a new metric to predict the damaging effects of variations not limited to single amino acid substitutions but also in-frame insertions, deletions, and multiple amino acid substitutions. This alignment-based score measures the change in sequence similarity of a query sequence to a protein sequence homolog before and after the introduction of an amino acid variation to the query sequence. Our results showed that the scoring scheme performs well in separating disease-associated variants (n = 21,662) from common polymorphisms (n = 37,022) for UniProt human protein variations, and also in separating deleterious variants (n = 15,179) from neutral variants (n = 17,891) for UniProt non-human protein variations. In our approach, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the human and non-human protein variation datasets is ∼0.85. We also observed that the alignment-based score correlates with the deleteriousness of a sequence variation. In summary, we have developed a new algorithm, PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer), which provides a generalized approach to predict the functional effects of protein sequence variations including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, and in-frame insertions and deletions. The PROVEAN tool is available online at http://provean.jcvi.org.},

abstract = {The effect of genetic mutation on phenotype is of significant interest in genetics. The type of genetic mutation that causes a single amino acid substitution (AAS) in a protein sequence is called a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP). An nsSNP could potentially affect the function of the protein, subsequently altering the carrier's phenotype. This protocol describes the use of the 'Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant' (SIFT) algorithm in predicting whether an AAS affects protein function. To assess the effect of a substitution, SIFT assumes that important positions in a protein sequence have been conserved throughout evolution and therefore substitutions at these positions may affect protein function. Thus, by using sequence homology, SIFT predicts the effects of all possible substitutions at each position in the protein sequence. The protocol typically takes 5-20 min, depending on the input. SIFT is available as an online tool (http://sift.jcvi.org).},

However, despite these encouraging figures, the success rate of clinical exome diagnosis remains low due to several factors including wrong variant annota-tion and nonoptimal filtration practices, which may lead to misinterpretation of disease-causing mutations. In this review, we describe the critical steps of variant annotation and filtration processes to highlight a handful of potential disease-causing mutations for downstream analysis. We report the key annotation elements to gather at multiple levels for each mutation, and which systems are designed to help in collecting this mandatory information.

The vast number of short reads produced by these techniques, however, pose significant computational challenges. The first step in many types of genomic analysis is the mapping of short reads to a reference genome, and several groups have developed dedicated algorithms and software packages to perform this function. As the developers of these packages optimize their algorithms with respect to various considerations, the relative merits of different software packages remain unclear. However, for scientists who generate and use NGS data for their specific research projects, an important consideration is choosing the software that is most suitable for their application.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: With a view to comparing existing short read alignment software, we develop a simulation and evaluation suite, Seal, which simulates NGS runs for different configurations of various factors, including sequencing error, indels and coverage. We also develop criteria to compare the performances of software with disparate output structure (e.g. some packages return a single alignment while some return multiple possible alignments). Using these criteria, we comprehensively evaluate the performances of Bowtie, BWA, mr- and mrsFAST, Novoalign, SHRiMP and SOAPv2, with regard to accuracy and runtime.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We expect that the results presented here will be useful to investigators in choosing the alignment software that is most suitable for their specific research aims.

abstract = {MOTIVATION Depletion of loss-of-function (LoF) mutations may provide a rank of genic functional intolerance and consequently susceptibility to disease. RESULTS Here we have studied LoF mutations in 60 706 unrelated individuals and show that the most intolerant quartile of ranked genes is enriched in rare and early onset diseases and explains 87{\%} of de novo haploinsufficient OMIM mutations, 17{\%} more than any other gene scoring tool. We detected particular enrichment in expression of the depleted LoF genes in brain (odds ratio = 1.5; P-value = 4.2e-07). By searching for de novo haploinsufficient mutations putatively associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in four recent studies, we were able to explain 81{\%} of them. Taken together, this study provides a novel gene intolerance ranking system, called LoFtool, which may help in ranking genes of interest based on their LoF intolerance and tissue expression. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION The LoFtool gene scores are available in the Supplementary data CONTACT: joaofadista@gmail.comSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {High-volume sequencing of DNA and RNA is now within reach of any research laboratory and is quickly becoming established as a key research tool. In many workflows, each of the short sequences ("reads") resulting from a sequencing run are first "mapped" (aligned) to a reference sequence to infer the read from which the genomic location derived, a challenging task because of the high data volumes and often large genomes. Existing read mapping software excel in either speed (e.g., BWA, Bowtie, ELAND) or sensitivity (e.g., Novoalign), but not in both. In addition, performance often deteriorates in the presence of sequence variation, particularly so for short insertions and deletions (indels). Here, we present a read mapper, Stampy, which uses a hybrid mapping algorithm and a detailed statistical model to achieve both speed and sensitivity, particularly when reads include sequence variation. This results in a higher useable sequence yield and improved accuracy compared to that of existing software.},

abstract = {DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) on a solid surface during polymerase reaction can decipher many sequences in parallel. We report here a DNA sequencing method that is a hybrid between the Sanger dideoxynucleotide terminating reaction and SBS. In this approach, four nucleotides, modified as reversible terminators by capping the 3'-OH with a small reversible moiety so that they are still recognized by DNA polymerase as substrates, are combined with four cleavable fluorescent dideoxynucleotides to perform SBS. The ratio of the two sets of nucleotides is adjusted as the extension cycles proceed. Sequences are determined by the unique fluorescence emission of each fluorophore on the DNA products terminated by ddNTPs. On removing the 3'-OH capping group from the DNA products generated by incorporating the 3'-O-modified dNTPs and the fluorophore from the DNA products terminated with the ddNTPs, the polymerase reaction reinitiates to continue the sequence determination. By using an azidomethyl group as a chemically reversible capping moiety in the 3'-O-modified dNTPs, and an azido-based cleavable linker to attach the fluorophores to the ddNTPs, we synthesized four 3'-O-azidomethyl-dNTPs and four ddNTP-azidolinker-fluorophores for the hybrid SBS. After sequence determination by fluorescence imaging, the 3'-O-azidomethyl group and the fluorophore attached to the DNA extension product via the azidolinker are efficiently removed by using Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in aqueous solution that is compatible with DNA. Various DNA templates, including those with homopolymer regions, were accurately sequenced with a read length of {\textgreater}30 bases by using this hybrid SBS method on a chip and a four-color fluorescence scanner.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies suggest that common genetic variants explain only a small fraction of heritable risk for common diseases, raising the question of whether rare variants account for a significant fraction of unexplained heritability1,2. While DNA sequencing costs have fallen dramatically3, they remain far from what is necessary for rare and novel variants to be routinely identified at a genome-wide scale in large cohorts. We have therefore sought to develop second- generation methods for targeted sequencing of all protein-coding regions (`exomes'), to reduce costs while enriching for discovery of highly penetrant variants. Here we report on the targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing of the exomes of twelve humans. These include eight HapMap individuals representing three populations4, and four unrelated individuals with a rare dominantly inherited disorder, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS)5. We demonstrate the sensitive and specific identification of rare and common variants in over 300 megabases (Mb) of coding sequence. Using FSS as a proof-of-concept, we show that candidate genes for monogenic disorders can be identified by exome sequencing of a small number of unrelated, affected individuals. This strategy may be extendable to diseases with more complex genetics through larger sample sizes and appropriate weighting of nonsynonymous variants by predicted functional impact.},

We compared whole exome sequencing (WES) with the most recent PCR-free whole genome sequencing (WGS), showing that only the latter is able to provide hitherto unprecedented complete coverage of the coding region of the genome. Thus, from a clinical/technical point of view, WGS is the better WES so that capturing is no longer necessary for the most comprehensive genomic testing of Mendelian disorders.},

We investigated whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) platforms offer improved coverage of coding regions compared with whole-exome sequencing (WES) platforms, and compared single-base coverage for a large set of exome and genome samples. We find that WES platforms have improved considerably in the last years, but at comparable sequencing depth, WGS outperforms WES in terms of covered coding regions. At higher sequencing depth (95x-160x), WES successfully captures 95{\%} of the coding regions with a minimal coverage of 20x, compared with 98{\%} for WGS at 87-fold coverage. Three different assessments of sequence coverage bias showed consistent biases for WES but not for WGS. We found no clear differences for the technologies concerning their ability to achieve complete coverage of 2,759 clinically relevant genes. We show that WES performs comparable to WGS in terms of covered bases if sequenced at two to three times higher coverage. This does, however, go at the cost of substantially more sequencing biases in WES approaches. Our findings will guide laboratories to make an informed decision on which sequencing platform and coverage to choose.},

The conference attracted more than two thousand scientists, medical doctors, engineers, professors and students gathered at Las Vegas, Nevada, USA during July 14-17 and received great success. Supported by International Society of Intelligent Biological Medicine (ISIBM), International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design (IJCBDD), International Journal of Functional Informatics and Personalized Medicine (IJFIPM) and the leading research laboratories from Harvard, M.I.T., Purdue, UIUC, UCLA, Georgia Tech, UT Austin, U. of Minnesota, U. of Iowa etc, the conference received thousands of research papers. Each submitted paper was reviewed by at least three reviewers and accepted papers were required to satisfy reviewers' comments. Finally, the review board and the committee decided to select only 19 high-quality research papers for inclusion in this supplement to BMC Genomics based on the peer reviews only. The conference committee was very grateful for the Plenary Keynote Lectures given by: Dr. Brian D. Athey (University of Michigan Medical School), Dr. Vladimir N. Uversky (Indiana University School of Medicine), Dr. David A. Patterson (Member of United States National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering, University of California at Berkeley) and Anousheh Ansari (Prodea Systems, Space Ambassador).

abstract = {Since the completion of the human genome project in 2003, extraordinary progress has been made in genome sequencing technologies, which has led to a decreased cost per megabase and an increase in the number and diversity of sequenced genomes. An astonishing complexity of genome architecture has been revealed, bringing these sequencing technologies to even greater advancements. Some approaches maximize the number of bases sequenced in the least amount of time, generating a wealth of data that can be used to understand increasingly complex phenotypes. Alternatively, other approaches now aim to sequence longer contiguous pieces of DNA, which are essential for resolving structurally complex regions. These and other strategies are providing researchers and clinicians a variety of tools to probe genomes in greater depth, leading to an enhanced understanding of how genome sequence variants underlie phenotype and disease.},

Recent years have seen the development of a variety of so-called 'next-generation' sequencing platforms, with several others anticipated to become available shortly. The previously unimaginable scale and economy of these methods, coupled with their enthusiastic uptake by the scientific community and the potential for further improvements in accuracy and read length, suggest that these technologies are destined to make a huge and ongoing impact upon genomic and post-genomic biology. However, like the analysis of microarray data and the assembly and annotation of complete genome sequences from conventional sequencing data, the management and analysis of next-generation sequencing data requires (and indeed has already driven) the development of informatics tools able to assemble, map, and interpret huge quantities of relatively or extremely short nucleotide sequence data. Here we provide a broad overview of bioinformatics approaches that have been introduced for several genomics and functional genomics applications of next-generation sequencing.},

We examine three human genomes and experimentally validate genome-wide copy- number differences. We estimate that 73–87 genes will be on average copy-number variable between two human genomes and find that these genic differences overwhelmingly correspond to segmental duplications (OR=135; p{\textless}2.2e-16).

abstract = {High-throughput technologies for DNA sequencing and for analyses of transcriptomes, proteomes and metabolomes have provided the foundations for deciphering the structure, variation and function of the human genome and relating them to health and disease states. The increased efficiency of DNA sequencing opens up the possibility of analyzing a large number of individual genomes and transcriptomes, and complete reference proteomes and metabolomes are within reach using powerful analytical techniques based on chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Computational and mathematical tools have enabled the development of systems approaches for deciphering the functional and regulatory networks underlying the behavior of complex biological systems. Further conceptual and methodological developments of these tools are needed for the integration of various data types across the multiple levels of organization and time frames that are characteristic of human development, physiology and disease. Medical genomics has attempted to overcome the initial limitations of genome-wide association studies and has identified a limited number of susceptibility loci for many complex and common diseases. Iterative systems approaches are starting to provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of human diseases, and to facilitate the development of better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for cancer and many other diseases. Systems approaches will transform the way drugs are developed through academy-industry partnerships that will target multiple components of networks and pathways perturbed in diseases. They will enable medicine to become predictive, personalized, preventive and participatory, and, in the process, concepts and methods from Western and oriental cultures can be combined. We recommend that systems medicine should be developed through an international network of systems biology and medicine centers dedicated to inter-disciplinary training and education, to help reduce the gap in healthcare between developed and developing countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The cancer transcriptome is difficult to explore due to the heterogeneity of quantitative and qualitative changes in gene expression linked to the disease status. An increasing number of "unconventional" transcripts, such as novel isoforms, non-coding RNAs, somatic gene fusions and deletions have been associated with the tumoral state. Massively parallel sequencing techniques provide a framework for exploring the transcriptional complexity inherent to cancer with a limited laboratory and financial effort. We developed a deep sequencing and bioinformatics analysis protocol to investigate the molecular composition of a breast cancer poly(A)+ transcriptome. This method utilizes a cDNA library normalization step to diminish the representation of highly expressed transcripts and biology-oriented bioinformatic analyses to facilitate detection of rare and novel transcripts. RESULTS We analyzed over 132,000 Roche 454 high-confidence deep sequencing reads from a primary human lobular breast cancer tissue specimen, and detected a range of unusual transcriptional events that were subsequently validated by RT-PCR in additional eight primary human breast cancer samples. We identified and validated one deletion, two novel ncRNAs (one intergenic and one intragenic), ten previously unknown or rare transcript isoforms and a novel gene fusion specific to a single primary tissue sample. We also explored the non-protein-coding portion of the breast cancer transcriptome, identifying thousands of novel non-coding transcripts and more than three hundred reads corresponding to the non-coding RNA MALAT1, which is highly expressed in many human carcinomas. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate that combining 454 deep sequencing with a normalization step and careful bioinformatic analysis facilitates the discovery and quantification of rare transcripts or ncRNAs, and can be used as a qualitative tool to characterize transcriptome complexity, revealing many hitherto unknown transcripts, splice isoforms, gene fusion events and ncRNAs, even at a relatively low sequence sampling.},

abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in human genomics have allowed unprecedented productivity in terms of algorithms, software, and literature available for translating raw next-generation sequence data into high-quality information. The challenges of variant identification in organisms with lower quality reference genomes are less well documented. We explored the consequences of commonly recommended preparatory steps and the effects of single and multi sample variant identification methods using four publicly available software applications (Platypus, HaplotypeCaller, Samtools and UnifiedGenotyper) on whole genome sequence data of 65 key ancestors of Swiss dairy cattle populations. Accuracy of calling next-generation sequence variants was assessed by comparison to the same loci from medium and high-density single nucleotide variant (SNV) arrays.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: The total number of SNVs identified varied by software and method, with single (multi) sample results ranging from 17.7 to 22.0 (16.9 to 22.0) million variants. Computing time varied considerably between software. Preparatory realignment of insertions and deletions and subsequent base quality score recalibration had only minor effects on the number and quality of SNVs identified by different software, but increased computing time considerably. Average concordance for single (multi) sample results with high-density chip data was 58.3{\{}{\%}{\}} (87.0{\{}{\%}{\}}) and average genotype concordance in correctly identified SNVs was 99.2{\{}{\%}{\}} (99.2{\{}{\%}{\}}) across software. The average quality of SNVs identified, measured as the ratio of transitions to transversions, was higher using single sample methods than multi sample methods. A consensus approach using results of different software generally provided the highest variant quality in terms of transition/transversion ratio.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings serve as a reference for variant identification pipeline development in non-human organisms and help assess the implication of preparatory steps in next-generation sequencing pipelines for organisms with incomplete reference genomes (pipeline code is included). Benchmarking this information should prove particularly useful in processing next-generation sequencing data for use in genome-wide association studies and genomic selection.},

abstract = {Effective use of the human and mouse genomes requires reliable identification of genes and their products. Although multiple public resources provide annotation, different methods are used that can result in similar but not identical representation of genes, transcripts, and proteins. The collaborative consensus coding sequence (CCDS) project tracks identical protein annotations on the reference mouse and human genomes with a stable identifier (CCDS ID), and ensures that they are consistently represented on the NCBI, Ensembl, and UCSC Genome Browsers. Importantly, the project coordinates on manually reviewing inconsistent protein annotations between sites, as well as annotations for which new evidence suggests a revision is needed, to progressively converge on a complete protein-coding set for the human and mouse reference genomes, while maintaining a high standard of reliability and biological accuracy. To date, the project has identified 20,159 human and 17,707 mouse consensus coding regions from 17,052 human and 16,893 mouse genes. Three evaluation methods indicate that the entries in the CCDS set are highly likely to represent real proteins, more so than annotations from contributing groups not included in CCDS. The CCDS database thus centralizes the function of identifying well-supported, identically-annotated, protein-coding regions.},

Studies of wound-associated microbial communities (microbiomes) to date have primarily relied upon culture-based methods, which are known to have extreme biases and are not reliable for the characterization of microbiomes. Biofilms are very resistant to culture and are therefore especially difficult to study with techniques that remain standard in clinical settings. Recent Advances: Culture-independent approaches employing next-generation DNA sequencing have provided researchers and clinicians a window into wound-associated microbiomes that could not be achieved before and has begun to transform our view of wound-associated biodiversity. Within the past decade, many platforms have arisen for performing this type of sequencing, with various types of applications for microbiome research being possible on each. Critical Issues: Wound care incorporating knowledge of microbiomes gained from next-generation sequencing could guide clinical management and treatments. The purpose of this review is to outline the current platforms, their applications, and the steps necessary to undertake microbiome studies using next-generation sequencing. Future Directions: As DNA sequencing technology progresses, platforms will continue to produce longer reads and more reads per run at lower costs. A major future challenge is to implement these technologies in clinical settings for more precise and rapid identification of wound bioburden.},

abstract = {Largely because of efforts required to complete the Human Genome Project, DNA sequencing has undergone a steady transformation with still-ongoing developments of high-throughput sequencing machines for which the cost per reaction is falling drastically. Similarly, the fast-changing landscape of reproductive technologies has been improved by genetic approaches. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis and screening were established more than two decades ago for selecting genetically normal embryos to avoid inherited diseases and to give the highest potential to achieve stable pregnancies. Most recent additions to the IVF practices (blastocyst/trophectoderm biopsy, embryo vitrification) and adoption of new genetics tools such as array comparative genome hybridization have allowed setting up more precise and efficient programs for clinical embryo diagnosis. Nevertheless, there is always room for improvements. Remarkably, a recent explosion in the release of advanced sequencing benchtop platforms, together with a certain maturity of bioinformatics tools, has set the target goal of sequencing individual cells for embryo diagnosis to be a realistically feasible scenario for the near future. Next-generation sequencing technology should provide the opportunity to simultaneously analyze single-gene disorders and perform an extensive comprehensive chromosome screening/diagnosis by concurrently sequencing, counting, and accurately assembling millions of DNA reads.

We use six different aligners and five different variant callers to determine which pipeline, of the 30 total, performs the best on a human exome that was used to help generate the list of variants detected by the Genome in a Bottle Consortium. Of these 30 pipelines, we found that Novoalign in conjunction with GATK UnifiedGenotyper exhibited the highest sensitivity while maintaining a low number of false positives for SNVs. However, it is apparent that indels are still difficult for any pipeline to handle with none of the tools achieving an average sensitivity higher than 33{\%} or a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) higher than 53{\%}. Lastly, as expected, it was found that aligners can play as vital a role in variant detection as variant callers themselves.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Variant annotation is a crucial step in the analysis of genome sequencing data. Functional annotation results can have a strong influence on the ultimate conclusions of disease studies. Incorrect or incomplete annotations can cause researchers both to overlook potentially disease-relevant DNA variants and to dilute interesting variants in a pool of false positives. Researchers are aware of these issues in general, but the extent of the dependency of final results on the choice of transcripts and software used for annotation has not been quantified in detail. METHODS This paper quantifies the extent of differences in annotation of 80 million variants from a whole-genome sequencing study. We compare results using the RefSeq and Ensembl transcript sets as the basis for variant annotation with the software Annovar, and also compare the results from two annotation software packages, Annovar and VEP (Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor), when using Ensembl transcripts. RESULTS We found only 44{\%} agreement in annotations for putative loss-of-function variants when using the RefSeq and Ensembl transcript sets as the basis for annotation with Annovar. The rate of matching annotations for loss-of-function and nonsynonymous variants combined was 79{\%} and for all exonic variants it was 83{\%}. When comparing results from Annovar and VEP using Ensembl transcripts, matching annotations were seen for only 65{\%} of loss-of-function variants and 87{\%} of all exonic variants, with splicing variants revealed as the category with the greatest discrepancy. Using these comparisons, we characterised the types of apparent errors made by Annovar and VEP and discuss their impact on the analysis of DNA variants in genome sequencing studies. CONCLUSIONS Variant annotation is not yet a solved problem. Choice of transcript set can have a large effect on the ultimate variant annotations obtained in a whole-genome sequencing study. Choice of annotation software can also have a substantial effect. The annotation step in the analysis of a genome sequencing study must therefore be considered carefully, and a conscious choice made as to which transcript set and software are used for annotation.},

@article{Zhao2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND RNA-Seq has become increasingly popular in transcriptome profiling. One aspect of transcriptome research is to quantify the expression levels of genomic elements, such as genes, their transcripts and exons. Acquiring a transcriptome expression profile requires genomic elements to be defined in the context of the genome. Multiple human genome annotation databases exist, including RefGene (RefSeq Gene), Ensembl, and the UCSC annotation database. The impact of the choice of an annotation on estimating gene expression remains insufficiently investigated. RESULTS In this paper, we systematically characterized the impact of genome annotation choice on read mapping and transcriptome quantification by analyzing a RNA-Seq dataset generated by the Human Body Map 2.0 Project. The impact of a gene model on mapping of non-junction reads is different from junction reads. For the RNA-Seq dataset with a read length of 75 bp, on average, 95{\%} of non-junction reads were mapped to exactly the same genomic location regardless of which gene models was used. By contrast, this percentage dropped to 53{\%} for junction reads. In addition, about 30{\%} of junction reads failed to align without the assistance of a gene model, while 10-15{\%} mapped alternatively. There are 21,958 common genes among RefGene, Ensembl, and UCSC annotations. When we compared the gene quantification results in RefGene and Ensembl annotations, 20{\%} of genes are not expressed, and thus have a zero count in both annotations. Surprisingly, identical gene quantification results were obtained for only 16.3{\%} (about one sixth) of genes. Approximately 28.1{\%} of genes' expression levels differed by 5{\%} or higher, and of those, the relative expression levels for 9.3{\%} of genes (equivalent to 2038) differed by 50{\%} or greater. The case studies revealed that the gene definition differences in gene models frequently result in inconsistency in gene quantification. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that the choice of a gene model has a dramatic effect on both gene quantification and differential analysis. Our research will help RNA-Seq data analysts to make an informed choice of gene model in practical RNA-Seq data analysis.},

abstract = {The tertiary structure of the DNA that makes up the eukaryotic genome is remarkably plastic, taking many different forms in response to the different needs of the cell. During the cell cycle of one cell, the DNA is replicated, reorganized into mitotic chromosomes, and decondensed into interphase chromatin. Within one cell at any given point in time, the chromatin is divided into hetero- and euchromatin reflecting active and inactive states of the DNA. This organization varies within one organism since different parts of the genome are active in different cell types. This article focuses on the most dramatic cell-type-specific DNA organization, that found in spermatozoa, in which the entire genome is reorganized into an inactive state that is more highly condensed than mitotic chromosomes. This unique example of eukaryotic DNA organization offers some interesting clues to the still unanswered questions about the role that the three-dimensional packaging of DNA plays in its function.},

abstract = {Autoradiographic procedures for the study of RNA and protein synthesis during spermatogenesis have been complemented with electron microscope techniques for visualization of gene activity. These procedures have enabled us to determine that RNA transcription is highly selective with respect to RNA species, timing of synthesis, types of chromosomes (autosomes and sex chromosomes), segments of chromosomes (i.e., the lampbrush segment), and chromatin structure. In mouse and human spermatocytes, a peak production of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) occurs during leptotene-zygotene, preceding nonnucleolar RNA synthesis, which is at a peak in middle pachytene. Transcription in late spermatids decreases in coincidence with changes in chromatin structure and high incorporation rates of [3H]arginine. In these cells, a particulate repeating pattern of chromatin is replaced by chromatin fibers of uniform diameter as highly arginine-rich proteins replace somatic histones. In spermatogonia, spermatocytes and Sertoli cells, the products of transcription are mainly heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) and rRNA, whereas spermatids transcribe predominantly hnRNA during early spermiogenesis. Persistent long-lived [3H]-uridine-labeled RNA species in pachytene spermatocyte nuclei contrast with a fast turnover of [3H]uridine-labeled RNA in Sertoli cells as detected at the same pulse labeling time (8--12 days). From these results one can postulate a still undefined control mechanism of gene expression during spermatogenesis for modulating a cascade of events required for male gamete formation.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Critical review of the literature. RESULT(S) Sperm from normospermic, fertile men have epigenetic modifications consistent with gene "poising" at the promoters of genes involved in development, including the localization of retained histones with bivalent histone modifications and hypomethylation of DNA. These epigenetic marks are altered in some patients with abnormal spermatogenesis, and in some men who exhibit unexplained, altered embryogenesis during IVF therapy. CONCLUSION(S) The sperm epigenome implies a poising of the paternal genome for embryogenesis and a possible role in the establishment of totipotency of the embryo and may help in understanding some causes of reduced fertility and transmission of disease risk.},

abstract = {Recent work in the field of male fertility has yielded significant increases in our understanding of the sperm epigenome and its potential role in embryonic development. These new findings have enabled a broad classification of a normal epigenetic state in the male gamete and have provided insight into the possible etiologies of some idiopathic male infertility cases. Histone retention and modification, protamine incorporation into the chromatin, DNA methylation, and spermatozoal RNA transcripts appear to play important roles in the epigenetic state of mature sperm. These epigenetic factors may reveal a historical record of spermatogenesis, portend future functions in embryogenesis, and help to elucidate mechanism of pluripotency. In contrast to the once held dogma regarding the importance of the paternal epigenome, the unique epigenetic landscape in sperm appears to serve more than the gamete itself and is likely influential in the developing embryo. In fact, growing evidence suggests that mature sperm provide appropriate epigenetic marks that drive specific genes toward activation and contribute to the pluripotent state of the embryonic cells. Although not definitive, the current literature provides evidence for the role of the sperm epigenome in the embryo. Future work must be focused on the characterization of epigenetic abnormalities commonly found in individuals with compromised fertility to further establish this role. Additionally, studies should target the effects of environment and aging on the sperm epigenetic program and subsequent fertility loss to determine the etiology of aberrant epigenetic profiles.},

abstract = {The fibrous sheath (FS) is a novel structural feature in the principal piece region of the sperm flagellum in marsupial and eutherian mammals. It begins anteriorly at the annulus, is composed of two longitudinal columns connected by circumferential ribs, and surrounds the outer dense fibers in the principal piece. The formation of the FS was described eloquently nearly twenty-five years ago, but the identification of its components has occurred only during the last few years. Most of the genes encoding the known FS components are expressed during the postmeiotic period of spermatogenesis, are expressed only in spermatogenic cells, and are either novel genes or paralogues of genes expressed in somatic cells. The proteins of the FS can be classified in nine categories based on their functional or structural roles. Most of these are resistant to solubilization and remain in the FS during rigorous isolation procedures. Mouse sperm with a knock out of the gene encoding GAPDHS are immotile, which demonstrates that most of the ATP needed for sperm motility is generated by glycolysis. Most of the glycolytic enzymes have been localised to the principal piece and some are tightly associated with the FS. However, the nature of the protein-protein interactions involved in assembly and maintenance of FS are known for only a few of the component proteins.},

abstract = {The details of a new fixation procedure using 40 per cent osmium tetroxide in carbon tetrachloride are presented. This fixative is a good general preservative, gives a higher contrast than the ordinary osmium fixatives, and may also preserve structures that are not otherwise readily revealed. Some possible reasons for the increased contrast are discussed. Micrographs of the sea urchin spermatozoa treated with the new fixative provide more detailed information on the tail structure than has heretofore been obtainable. This information is summarized in the diagrammatic text-figure. The sperm tail can no longer be regarded as having a bilateral symmetry, and thus, it is possible to assign an index number to each of the nine peripheral filaments. The nine peripheral filaments have a complex morphology, each one of them seems to be composed of two subunits that have unequal diameters. The slightly larger subunits are all found in the clockwise direction with regard to the other subunit or are all found in the counter-clockwise direction in the sectioned tail. Each of the slightly larger subunits is at intervals provided with two types of projections-referred to as the arms and the spokes-that extend in respective tangential and radial direction. The arms from one filament may be in actual contact with its neighboring filament through a complex bridge-like formation. There is a quantitative difference between the nine filaments with regard to this bridge. It is assumed that the eleven tail filaments follow straight paths. Some hypotheses on sperm movement are discussed based on this assumption and on the fact that the oscillations of an actively working sperm tail are in one plane. Probably, the nine peripheral filaments have non-equivalent functions in tail movement. In the centriole the nine peripheral filaments characteristically appear as triplets in a whorl-like arrangement. It is suggested that the inner part of this triplet is a derivation of the arms. A structural abnormality of the tail is described that is characterized by two or three complete sets of tail filaments within one cell membrane.},

Recent studies have revealed the molecular structures and functions of a number of axonemal components, including the motor molecules, the dyneins, and regulatory substructures, such as radial spoke, central pair, and other accessory structures. The force for flagellar movement is exerted by the sliding of outer-doublet microtubules driven by the molecular motors, the dyneins. Dynein activity is regulated by the radial spoke/central pair apparatus through protein phosphorylation, resulting in flagellar bend propagation.

These changes are triggered by changes in the extracellular ionic environment and substances released from the female reproductive tract or egg. After reception of these extracellular signa...},

abstract = {Protamines are the major DNA-binding proteins in the nucleus of sperm in most vertebrates and package the DNA in a volume less than 5{\%} of a somatic cell nucleus. Many mammals have one protamine, but a few species, including humans and mice, have two. Here we use gene targeting to determine if the second protamine provides redundancy to an essential process, or if both protamines are necessary. We disrupted the coding sequence of one allele of either Prm1 or Prm2 in embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from 129-strain mice, and injected them into blastocysts from C57BL/6-strain mice. Male chimeras produced 129-genotype sperm with disrupted Prm1 or Prm2 alleles, but failed to sire offspring carrying the 129 genome. We also found that a decrease in the amount of either protamine disrupts nuclear formation, processing of protamine-2 and normal sperm function. Our studies show that both protamines are essential and that haploinsufficiency caused by a mutation in one allele of Prm1 or Prm2 prevents genetic transmission of both mutant and wild-type alleles.},

abstract = {Spermiogenesis constitutes the steps involved in the metamorphosis of spermatids into spermatozoa. It involves modification of several organelles in addition to the formation of several structures including the flagellum and cytoplasmic droplet. The flagellum is composed of a neck region and middle, principal, and end pieces. The axoneme composed of nine outer microtubular doublets circularly arranged to form a cylinder around a central pair of microtubules is present throughout the flagellum. The middle and principal pieces each contain specific components such as the mitochondrial sheath and fibrous sheath, respectively, while outer dense fibers are common to both. A plethora of proteins are constituents of each of these structures, with each playing key roles in functions related to the fertility of spermatozoa. At the end of spermiogenesis, a portion of spermatid cytoplasm remains associated with the released spermatozoa, referred to as the cytoplasmic droplet. The latter has as its main feature Golgi saccules, which appear to modify the plasma membrane of spermatozoa as they move down the epididymal duct and hence may be partly involved in male gamete maturation. The end product of spermatogenesis is highly streamlined and motile spermatozoa having a condensed nucleus equipped with an acrosome. Spermatozoa move through the female reproductive tract and eventually penetrate the zona pellucida and bind to the egg plasma membrane. Many proteins have been implicated in the process of fertilization as well as a plethora of proteins involved in the development of spermatids and sperm, and these are high lighted in this review.},

However, when mouse spermatids were fused with oocytes, some of the resulting zygotes developed into normal fertile mice of either sex. This demonstrates that the nuclei of spermatids can provide the paternally imprinted chromosomes needed for full embryonic development and also that the complex postmeiotic modifications involved in sperm formation in the testis and their maturation in the epididymis merely serve to facilitate natural delivery of the paternal genome. This finding may find an application in the treatment of male infertility due to defective spermiogenesis/sperm maturation.},

abstract = {Genomic imprinting occurs in both male and female gametes during gametogenesis, but the exact time when imprinting begins and ends is unknown. In the present study we injected nuclei of testicular spermatozoa and round spermatids into mature mouse oocytes to see whether these nuclei are able to participate in syngamy and normal embryonic development. If the injected oocytes develop into normal fertile offspring, imprinting in the male germ cells used must have been completed by the time of injection. Ninety-two percent of mouse oocytes injected with testicular spermatozoa survived and 94{\%} of these were fertilized normally (extrusion of the second polar body and formation of male and female pronuclei). When 44 two-cell embryos so created were transferred to 5 foster mothers, 24 (54.5{\%}) developed into normal offspring. Unlike testicular spermatozoa, round spermatids could not activate the oocytes, and therefore the oocytes had to be activated artificially either before or after spermatid injection. The highest rate (77{\%}) of normal fertilization was obtained when the oocytes were first activated by electric current, then injected individually with a single spermatid nucleus. When 131 two-cell embryos were transferred to 15 foster mothers, 37 (28.2{\%}) reached full term. All but two grew into healthy adults. Thus, it would appear that gametic imprinting in mouse spermatogenic cells is completed before spermiogenesis begins. Under the experimental conditions employed, spermatid nuclei were less efficient than testicular sperm nuclei in producing normal offspring, but perhaps this was due to technical rather than inherent problems.},

abstract = {Round spermatids, precursor male gametes, are known to possess the potential to achieve fertilization and embryonic development when injected into eggs. However, injection of spermatids alone seldom activates eggs in the mouse, as spermatids by themselves cannot induce an increase in intracellular Ca2+, a prerequisite for egg activation. We injected a mouse round spermatid into an egg simultaneously with partially purified sperm factor from differentiated hamster spermatozoa. The combined injection produced repetitive Ca2+ increases (Ca2+ oscillations) lasting for at least 4 h as observed at fertilization, and induced activation in 92{\%} of eggs. This method provided 75{\%} fertilization success associated with male and female pronucleus formation and development to 2-cell embryos, while only 7{\%} of eggs were fertilized by injection of a spermatid alone. Of the 2-cell embryos, approximately 50{\%} developed to blastocysts during 5 days of culture in vitro, while no blastocysts were obtained following injection of sperm factor alone. Furthermore, the 2-cell embryos, that were created by spermatids and sperm factor and transplanted into foster mothers, developed into normal offspring, although the percentage was only 22{\%}. All infants grew into healthy adults carrying normal chromosomes. The sperm factor served as a complementary factor for successful fertilization by round spermatid injection.},

Identification of the cell types, which are described and illustrated, was consistent and reproducible; the advantages of the different stainings in their analysis is documented. The cell counts were tested for reproducibility and compared to the histologic diagnoses and sperm counts. Statistical analysis showed the highest reproducibility for cells frequently encountered in smears (0.99 for Sertoli cells and 0.98 for spermatozoa) and the lowest but still satisfactory reproducibility for rare or arbitrarily defined cell forms (0.71 for dark spermatogonia and 0.76 for secondary spermatocytes). The high reproducibility of the smear quantification permits the introduction of a number of indices, defining clinically useful relations between cell types that are indicative of various types of infertility. The data obtained by cytologic quantification showed reasonably good correlation with the histologic diagnoses of desquamation and focal fibrosis and excellent correlation with Sertoli cells only, arrested spermatogenesis and complete fibrosis. The cytologic quantification of testicular smears adds considerable information to the diagnosis of impaired fertility and should be instituted in properly equipped centers.},

abstract = {Testicular biopsies were obtained at various intervals after intra-testicular injections of tritiated thymidine. Radioautographs revealed that the most mature labeled germ cells were the preleptotene spermatocytes at 1 hour, the midpachytene spermatocytes at 16 days, and the immature spermatids at 32 days after injection. These results indicated that one cycle of the seminiferous epithelium lasts 16 days, and the whole of spermatogenesis is estimated to con-sume approximately 64 days. In sharp contrast to other mammalian species, the arrangement of germ cells in the human seminiferous epithelium appears to be and always has been con-sidered chaotic. No clearcut cellular association could, until recently, be identified and the "cycle of the semi-niferous epithelium" in man was said to be nonexistent. This lack of organi-zation would obviously hinder any eval-uation of the rate of development of the germinal elements. Recently Cler-mont (1) determined the composition of six typical cellular associations and described the cyclic evolution of the seminiferous epithelium in man. These findings were confirmed and applied to studies on the effects of diamines on human spermatogenesis (2). These cellular relations have been used in the present investigation to obtain an esti-mate of the duration of spermatogenesis. In a few mammals, spermatogenesis, the process by which spermatogonial stem cells proliferate and transform into spermatozoa, has been accurately timed by labeling resting (also called pre-leptotene) spermatocytes with a DNA precursor and radioautographing sec-tions of testis at various time intervals},

abstract = {The physiological function of spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and mammals is to produce spermatozoa (1n, haploid) that contain only half of the genetic material of spermatogonia (2n, diploid). This half number of chromosomes from a spermatozoon will then be reconstituted to become a diploid cell upon fertilization with an egg, which is also haploid. Thus, genetic information from two parental individuals can be passed onto their offspring. Spermatogenesis takes place in the seminiferous epithelium of the seminiferous tubule, the functional unit of the mammalian testis. In mammals, particularly in rodents, the fascinating morphological changes that occur during spermatogenesis involving cellular differentiation and transformation, mitosis, meiosis, germ cell movement, spermiogenesis and spermiation have been well documented from the 1950s through the 1980s. During this time, however, the regulation of, as well as the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse cellular events occurring throughout spermatogenesis, have remained largely unexplored. In the past two decades, important advancements have been made using new biochemical, cell and molecular biology techniques to understand how different genes, proteins and signalling pathways regulate various aspects of spermatogenesis. These include studies on the differentiation of spermatogonia from gonocytes; regulation of spermatogonial stem cells; regulation of spermatogonial mitosis; regulation of meiosis, spermiogenesis and spermiation; role of hormones (e.g. oestrogens, androgens) in spermatogenesis; transcriptional regulation of spermatogenesis; regulation of apoptosis; cell-cell interactions; and the biology of junction dynamics during spermatogenesis. The impact of environmental toxicants on spermatogenesis has also become an urgent issue in the field in light of declining fertility levels in males. Many of these studies have helped investigators to understand important similarities, differences and evolutionary relationships between C. elegans, D. melanogaster and mammals relating to spermatogenesis. In this Special Issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, we have covered many of these areas, and in this Introduction, we highlight the topic of spermatogenesis by examining its past, present and future.},

abstract = {Proacrosin biosynthesis timing during human spermatogenesis has been studied using the monoclonal antibody 4D4 (mAb 4D4). Frozen and paraffin-embedded sections of testicular biopsies were labelled by standard indirect immunofluorescence and avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase procedures. The labelling specificity was checked by immunochemistry assays on unrelated tissues and by western blotting of testis extracts showing that only the 50-55 x 10(3) Mr proacrosin was recognized by mAb 4D4. Proacrosin was first observed in the Golgi region of midpachytene primary spermatocytes. In late pachytene primary spermatocytes, proacrosin was observed in two regions located at opposite nuclear poles. During the subsequent steps of the first meiotic division, the two bodies containing proacrosin were located: (i) on opposite sides of the equatorial plate during metaphase; (ii) along the microtubular spindle during anaphase; and (iii) close to each chromosomal aggregate during telophase. Two bodies containing proacrosin were still observed in interphasic secondary spermatocytes. The single labelled area observed in early spermatids was found to increase considerably in size during spermiogenesis. Anomalies of proacrosin scattering were observed in patients with Golgi complex partitioning failure. These data reveal proacrosin biosynthesis during diploid and haploid phases of human spermatogenesis and the proacrosin partitioning pattern during meiosis.},

Many of the changes are associated with the acquisition of the capacity to support post-fertilization development. Our knowledge of this aspect has greatly increased- for example, insights into how the re-establishment of parental imprints is regulated. In addition, an emerging theme from recent studies is that epigenetic modifiers have key roles in germ-cell development itself--for example, epigenetics contributes to the gene-expression programme that is required for germ-cell development, regulation of meiosis and genomic integrity. Understanding epigenetic regulation in germ cells has implications for reproductive engineering technologies and human health.},

abstract = {The primary function of the mammalian testis is the production of both gametes and hormones over a reproductive lifespan. This production of gametes proceeds in the seminiferous tubules and is supported by a stem cell population, the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Like other tissue-specific stem cells, SSCs are defined by their ability to balance between self-renewal and differentiation. This balance maintains the stem cell pool and guarantees the daily production of spermatozoa from puberty onward. Studying SSCs is difficult because they are very few in number (0.03{\%} of all germ cells), and specific markers have not been identified so far. Most of our knowledge results from experiments in rodent models. Very little is known about human SSCs. This review provides an update on SSCs, on their role in male fertility, and on (future) clinical applications using these fascinating cells.},

abstract = {Based on enumeration of maturation-phase spermatids in testicular homogenates from adult men and rats, daily sperm production per gram of testicular parenchyma (DSP/g) was almost seven times greater in rats (21.1 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.9 x 106 vs 3.1 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.5 x 106 ; x {\{}+/-{\}} SEM, n = 10). The relative inefficiency of the human testis was uniformly expressed in cranial, equatorial and caudal regions. Furthermore, DSP/g was highly correlated between paired testes from individual men (r = +0.97, n = 10), and differences between paired testes were not significantly different from zero (P{\textgreater}0.4). Histometric analysis of glutaraldehyde-perfused testes revealed differences (P{\textless}0.05) in relative testicular compositions between humans and rats (n = 3) including higher proportions of parenchyma, seminiferous tubules, seminiferous epithelium and germinal cells in the rat testis. Humans exceeded rats only in the proportions of testis occupied by nongerminal components such as tunic, interstitium, tubule boundary tissue and Sertoli cells. Histometric determination of the proportion of the testicular parenchyma occupied by these nuclei and consideration of average volume of round spermatid nuclei yielded DSP/g estimates of 17.4 {\{}+/-{\}} 1.8 x 106 in rats (not significantly different from the result by the homogenization method) and 8.5 {\{}+/-{\}} 1.3 x 106 in humans (almost three times higher than the value obtained by the homogenization method). Although the disparity between values for human DSP/g obtained by the two methods cannot yet be explained, several lines of evidence suggest that the time divisor used for human material processed by the homogenization method is too long, thus yielding an underestimation of daily sperm production. While its absolute accuracy is questionable, the homogenization method remains a rapid and precise technique for estimating DSP/g in humans. Histometric analysis and histometric estimation of DSP/g support the concept that the human is less efficient in sperm production than the rat, but these methods suggest that the rat is only about twice as efficient per gram of testicular parenchyma as the human.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {We recently identified the DPY19L2 gene as the main genetic cause of human globozoospermia (70{\{}{\%}{\}}) and described that Dpy19l2 knockout (KO) mice faithfully reproduce the human phenotype of globozoospermia making it an excellent model to characterize the molecular physiopathology of globozoospermia. Recent case studies on non-genetically characterized men with globozoospermia showed that phospholipase C, zeta (PLC{\$}\zeta{\$}), the sperm factor thought to induce the Ca(2+) oscillations at fertilization, was absent from their sperm, explaining the poor fertilization potential of these spermatozoa. Since 30{\{}{\%}{\}} of globozoospermic men remain genetically uncharacterized, the absence of PLC{\$}\zeta{\$} in DPY19L2 globozoospermic men remains to be formally established. Moreover, the precise localization of PLC{\$}\zeta{\$} and the reasons underlying its loss during spermatogenesis in globozoospermic patients are still not understood. Herein, we show that PLC{\$}\zeta{\$} is absent, or its presence highly reduced, in human and mouse sperm with DPY19L2-associated globozoospermia. As a consequence, fertilization with sperm from Dpy19l2 KO mice failed to initiate Ca(2+) oscillations and injected oocytes remained arrested at the metaphase II stage, although a few human oocytes injected with DPY19L2-defective sperm showed formation of 2-pronuclei embryos. We report for the first time the subcellular localization of PLC{\$}\zeta{\$} in control human sperm, which is along the inner acrosomal membrane and in the perinuclear theca, in the area corresponding to the equatorial region. Because these cellular components are absent in globozoospermic sperm, the loss of PLC{\$}\zeta{\$} in globozoospermic sperm is thus consistent and reinforces the role of PLC{\$}\zeta{\$} as an oocyte activation factor necessary for oocyte activation. In our companion article, we showed that chromatin compaction during spermiogenesis in Dpy19l2 KO mouse is defective and leads to sperm DNA damage. Together, these defects explain the poor fertilization potential of DPY19L2-globozoospermic sperm and the compromised developmental potential of embryos obtained using sperm from patients with a deletion of the DPY19L2 gene.},

abstract = {The kinetics of spermatogenesis in mammals are reviewed with special emphasis on the seminiferous epithelium cycle and spermatogonial renewal .  2 features of the spermatogenic process are that for a given species each step of spermatogenesis has a constant duration and that many spermatogonial stem cells enter spermatogenesis simultaneously and almost synchronously.  The seminiferous epithelium composed of 5 or 6 generations of germ cells form cellular associations of fixed compositi on.  Spermatids at a given step of spermiogenesis are always associated with spermatocytes and spermatogonia at given steps of development.  These cellular groupings were taken to represent stages of a cycle of the seminferous epithelium.  The number of stages composing the cycle vary with the species and the criteria used to characterize them.  The classifications of cell associations are particulary useful in investigations of the mode of renewal of the spermatogonial population.  The stem cells that belong to the Type A category may be classified as "reserve" and "renewing" stem cells.  The former appear to be actively involved in the production of spermatocytes in normal adult animals but the latter initiate at each cycle of the seminiferous epithelium a series of mitoses during which they renew themselves and  simultaneously give rise to "differentiating" spermatogonia.  The "nodal" or key mitosis that result appear to be equivalent in type and not bivalent.},

abstract = {The acrosome is an organelle that is central to sperm physiology and a defective acrosome biogenesis leads to globozoospermia, a severe male infertility. The identification of the actors involved in acrosome biogenesis is therefore particularly important to decipher the molecular pathogeny of globozoospermia. We recently showed that a defect in the DPY19L2 gene is present in more than 70{\%} of globozoospermic men and demonstrated that Dpy19l2, located in the inner nuclear membrane, is the first protein involved in the attachment of the acrosome to the nuclear envelope (NE). SUN proteins serve to link the nuclear envelope to the cytoskeleton and are therefore good candidates to participate in acrosome-nucleus attachment, potentially by interacting with DPY19L2. In order to characterize new actors of acrosomal attachment, we focused on Sun5 (also called Spag4l), which is highly expressed in male germ cells, and investigated its localization during spermatogenesis. Using immunohistochemistry and Western blot experiments in mice, we showed that Sun5 transits through different cellular compartments during meiosis. In pachytene spermatocytes, it is located in a membranous compartment different to the reticulum. In round spermatids, it progresses to the Golgi and the NE before to be located to the tail/head junction in epididymal sperm. Interestingly, we demonstrate that Sun5 is not, as initially reported, facing the acrosome but is in fact excluded from this zone. Moreover, we show that in Dpy19l2 KO spermatids, upon the detachment of the acrosome, Sun5 relocalizes to the totality of the NE suggesting that the acrosome attachment excludes Sun5 from the NE facing the acrosome. Finally, Western-blot experiments demonstrate that Sun5 is glycosylated. Overall, our work, associated with other publications, strongly suggests that the attachment of the acrosome to the nucleus does not likely depend on the formation of SUN complexes.},

Male factors are believed to be responsible for 20-50{\%} of all infertility cases, but microdeletions of the Y chromosome are the only genetic defects altering human spermatogenesis that have been reported repeatedly. We focused our work on infertile men with a normal somatic karyotype but typical spermatozoa mainly characterized by large heads, a variable number of tails and an increased chromosomal content (OMIM 243060). We performed a genome-wide microsatellite scan on ten infertile men presenting this characteristic phenotype. In all of these men, we identified a common region of homozygosity harboring the aurora kinase C gene (AURKC) with a single nucleotide deletion in the AURKC coding sequence. In addition, we show that this founder mutation results in premature termination of translation, yielding a truncated protein that lacks the kinase domain. We conclude that the absence of AURKC causes male infertility owing to the production of large-headed multiflagellar polyploid spermatozoa.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In mammals, oocyte activation at fertilization is thought to be induced by the sperm-specific phospholipase C zeta (PLCzeta). However, it still remains to be conclusively shown that PLCzeta is the endogenous agent of oocyte activation. Some types of human infertility appear to be caused by failure of the sperm to activate and this may be due to specific defects in PLCzeta. METHODS AND RESULTS Immunofluorescence studies showed PLCzeta to be localized in the equatorial region of sperm from fertile men, but sperm deficient in oocyte activation exhibited no specific signal in this same region. Immunoblot analysis revealed reduced amounts of PLCzeta in sperm from infertile men, and in some cases, the presence of an abnormally low molecular weight form of PLCzeta. In one non-globozoospermic case, DNA analysis identified a point mutation in the PLCzeta gene that leads to a significant amino acid change in the catalytic region of the protein. Structural modelling suggested that this defect may have important effects upon the structure and function of the PLCzeta protein. cRNA corresponding to mutant PLCzeta failed to induce calcium oscillations when microinjected into mouse oocytes. Injection of infertile human sperm into mouse oocytes failed to activate the oocyte or trigger calcium oscillations. Injection of such infertile sperm followed by two calcium pulses, induced by assisted oocyte activation, activated the oocytes without inducing the typical pattern of calcium oscillations. CONCLUSIONS Our findings illustrate the importance of PLCzeta during fertilization and suggest that mutant forms of PLCzeta may underlie certain types of human male infertility.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Globozoospermia is a male infertility phenotype characterized by the presence in the ejaculate of near 100{\%} acrosomeless round-headed spermatozoa with normal chromosomal content. Following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) these spermatozoa give a poor fertilization rate and embryonic development. We showed previously that most patients have a 200 kb homozygous deletion, which includes DPY19L2 whole coding sequence. Furthermore we showed that the DPY19L2 protein is located in the inner nuclear membrane of spermatids during spermiogenesis and that it is necessary to anchor the acrosome to the nucleus thus performing a function similar to that realized by Sun proteins within the LINC-complex (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton). SUN1 was described to be necessary for gametogenesis and was shown to interact with the telomeres. It is therefore possible that Dpy19l2 could also interact, directly or indirectly, with the DNA and modulate gene expression during spermatogenesis. In this study, we compared the transcriptome of testes from Dpy19l2 knock out and wild type mice in order to identify a potential deregulation of transcripts that could explain the poor fertilization potential of Dpy19l2 mutated spermatozoa. METHODS RNA was extracted from testes from DPY19L2 knock out and wild type mice. The transcriptome was carried out using GeneChip{\textregistered} Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Arrays. The biological processes and molecular functions of the differentially regulated genes were analyzed with the PANTHER software. RESULTS A total of 76 genes were deregulated, 70 were up-regulated and 6 (including Dpy19l2) were down-regulated. These genes were found to be involved in DNA/RNA binding, structural organization, transport and catalytic activity. CONCLUSIONS We describe that an important number of genes are differentially expressed in Dpy19l2 mice. This work could help improving our understanding of Dpy19l2 functions and lead to a better comprehension of the molecular mechanism involved in spermatogenesis.

@article{Harbuz2011,
abstract = {An increasing number of couples require medical assistance to achieve a pregnancy, and more than 2{\%} of the births in Western countries now result from assisted reproductive technologies. To identify genetic variants responsible for male infertility, we performed a whole-genome SNP scan on patients presenting with total globozoospermia, a primary infertility phenotype characterized by the presence of 100{\%} round acrosomeless spermatozoa in the ejaculate. This strategy allowed us to identify in most patients (15/20) a 200 kb homozygous deletion encompassing only DPY19L2, which is highly expressed in the testis. Although there was no known function for DPY19L2 in humans, previous work indicated that its ortholog in C. elegans is involved in cell polarity. In man, the DPY19L2 region has been described as a copy-number variant (CNV) found to be duplicated and heterozygously deleted in healthy individuals. We show here that the breakpoints of the deletions are located on a highly homologous 28 kb low copy repeat (LCR) sequence present on each side of DPY19L2, indicating that the identified deletions were probably produced by nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between these two regions. We demonstrate that patients with globozoospermia have a homozygous deletion of DPY19L2, thus indicating that DPY19L2 is necessary in men for sperm head elongation and acrosome formation. A molecular diagnosis can now be proposed to affected men; the presence of the deletion confirms the diagnosis of globozoospermia and assigns a poor prognosis for the success of in vitro fertilization.},
