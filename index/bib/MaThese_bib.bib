abstract = {The physiological function of spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and mammals is to produce spermatozoa (1n, haploid) that contain only half of the genetic material of spermatogonia (2n, diploid). This half number of chromosomes from a spermatozoon will then be reconstituted to become a diploid cell upon fertilization with an egg, which is also haploid. Thus, genetic information from two parental individuals can be passed onto their offspring. Spermatogenesis takes place in the seminiferous epithelium of the seminiferous tubule, the functional unit of the mammalian testis. In mammals, particularly in rodents, the fascinating morphological changes that occur during spermatogenesis involving cellular differentiation and transformation, mitosis, meiosis, germ cell movement, spermiogenesis and spermiation have been well documented from the 1950s through the 1980s. During this time, however, the regulation of, as well as the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse cellular events occurring throughout spermatogenesis, have remained largely unexplored. In the past two decades, important advancements have been made using new biochemical, cell and molecular biology techniques to understand how different genes, proteins and signalling pathways regulate various aspects of spermatogenesis. These include studies on the differentiation of spermatogonia from gonocytes; regulation of spermatogonial stem cells; regulation of spermatogonial mitosis; regulation of meiosis, spermiogenesis and spermiation; role of hormones (e.g. oestrogens, androgens) in spermatogenesis; transcriptional regulation of spermatogenesis; regulation of apoptosis; cell-cell interactions; and the biology of junction dynamics during spermatogenesis. The impact of environmental toxicants on spermatogenesis has also become an urgent issue in the field in light of declining fertility levels in males. Many of these studies have helped investigators to understand important similarities, differences and evolutionary relationships between C. elegans, D. melanogaster and mammals relating to spermatogenesis. In this Special Issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, we have covered many of these areas, and in this Introduction, we highlight the topic of spermatogenesis by examining its past, present and future.},

@article{Escalier1991,
abstract = {Proacrosin biosynthesis timing during human spermato-genesis has been studied using the monoclonal antibody 4D4 (mAb 4D4). Frozen and paraffin-embedded sections of testicular biopsies were labelled by standard indirect immunofluorescence and avidin-biotin immunoperoxi-dase procedures. The labelling specificity was checked by immunochemistry assays on unrelated tissues and by western blotting of testis extracts showing that only the 50-55 xK{\^{}}Mr proacrosin was recognized by mAb 4D4. Proacrosin was first observed in the Golgi region of mid-pachytene primary spermatocytes. In late pachytene primary spermatocytes, proacrosin was observed in two regions located at opposite nuclear poles. During the subsequent steps of the first meiotic division, the two bodies containing proacrosin were located: (i) on opposite sides of the equatorial plate during metaphase; (ii) along the microtubular spindle during anaphase; and (iii) close to each chromosomal aggregate during telophase. Two bodies containing proacrosin were still observed in interphasic secondary spermatocytes. The single labelled area observed in early spermatids was found to increase considerably in size during spermio-genesis. Anomalies of proacrosin scattering were ob-served in patients with Golgi complex partitioning failure. These data' reveal proacrosin biosynthesis during diploid and haploid phases of human spermato-genesis and the proacrosin partitioning pattern during meiosis.},

@article{Goossens2013,
abstract = {The primary function of the mammalian testis is the production of both gametes and hormones over a reproductive lifespan. This production of gametes proceeds in the seminiferous tubules and is supported by a stem cell population, the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Like other tissue-specific stem cells, SSCs are defined by their ability to balance between self-renewal and differentiation. This balance maintains the stem cell pool and guarantees the daily production of spermatozoa from puberty onward. Studying SSCs is difficult because they are very few in number (0.03{\%} of all germ cells), and specific markers have not been identified so far. Most of our knowledge results from experiments in rodent models. Very little is known about human SSCs. This review provides an update on SSCs, on their role in male fertility, and on (future) clinical applications using these fascinating cells.},

abstract = {The epigenetic profile of germ cells, which is defined by modifications of DNA and chromatin, changes dynamically during their development. Many of the changes are associated with the acquisition of the capacity to support post-fertilization development. Our knowledge of this aspect has greatly increased- for example, insights into how the re-establishment of parental imprints is regulated. In addition, an emerging theme from recent studies is that epigenetic modifiers have key roles in germ-cell development itself--for example, epigenetics contributes to the gene-expression programme that is required for germ-cell development, regulation of meiosis and genomic integrity. Understanding epigenetic regulation in germ cells has implications for reproductive engineering technologies and human health.},

Proteins from the septin family have been shown to localize to the annulus. A septin complex is assembled early in spermiogenesis with the cochaperone DNAJB13 and, in mature sperm, associates with Testis Anion Transporter 1; SLC26A8 (Tat1), a transmembrane protein of the SLC26 family. Studies in mice have shown that the annulus acts as a barrier to protein diffusion and controls correct organization of the midpiece. Consistent with these findings, absence of the annulus is associated with flagellum differentiation defects and asthenozoospermia in humans.},
