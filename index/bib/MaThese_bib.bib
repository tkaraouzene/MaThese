@article{Goossens2013,
abstract = {The primary function of the mammalian testis is the production of both gametes and hormones over a reproductive lifespan. This production of gametes proceeds in the seminiferous tubules and is supported by a stem cell population, the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Like other tissue-specific stem cells, SSCs are defined by their ability to balance between self-renewal and differentiation. This balance maintains the stem cell pool and guarantees the daily production of spermatozoa from puberty onward. Studying SSCs is difficult because they are very few in number (0.03{\%} of all germ cells), and specific markers have not been identified so far. Most of our knowledge results from experiments in rodent models. Very little is known about human SSCs. This review provides an update on SSCs, on their role in male fertility, and on (future) clinical applications using these fascinating cells.},

@article{Sasaki2008,
abstract = {The epigenetic profile of germ cells, which is defined by modifications of DNA and chromatin, changes dynamically during their development. Many of the changes are associated with the acquisition of the capacity to support post-fertilization development. Our knowledge of this aspect has greatly increased- for example, insights into how the re-establishment of parental imprints is regulated. In addition, an emerging theme from recent studies is that epigenetic modifiers have key roles in germ-cell development itself--for example, epigenetics contributes to the gene-expression programme that is required for germ-cell development, regulation of meiosis and genomic integrity. Understanding epigenetic regulation in germ cells has implications for reproductive engineering technologies and human health.},
