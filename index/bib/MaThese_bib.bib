abstract = {MOTIVATION: The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques presents many novel opportunities for many applications in life sciences. The vast number of short reads produced by these techniques, however, pose significant computational challenges. The first step in many types of genomic analysis is the mapping of short reads to a reference genome, and several groups have developed dedicated algorithms and software packages to perform this function. As the developers of these packages optimize their algorithms with respect to various considerations, the relative merits of different software packages remain unclear. However, for scientists who generate and use NGS data for their specific research projects, an important consideration is choosing the software that is most suitable for their application.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: With a view to comparing existing short read alignment software, we develop a simulation and evaluation suite, Seal, which simulates NGS runs for different configurations of various factors, including sequencing error, indels and coverage. We also develop criteria to compare the performances of software with disparate output structure (e.g. some packages return a single alignment while some return multiple possible alignments). Using these criteria, we comprehensively evaluate the performances of Bowtie, BWA, mr- and mrsFAST, Novoalign, SHRiMP and SOAPv2, with regard to accuracy and runtime.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We expect that the results presented here will be useful to investigators in choosing the alignment software that is most suitable for their specific research aims. Our results also provide insights into the factors that should be considered to use alignment results effectively. Seal can also be used to evaluate the performance of algorithms that use deep sequencing data for various purposes (e.g. identification of genomic variants).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: Seal is available as open source at http://compbio.case.edu/seal/.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: matthew.ruffalo@case.edu$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {We present primary results from the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) project, coordinated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Examining Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies SOLiD and Roche 454 platforms at multiple laboratory sites using reference RNA samples with built-in controls, we assess RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performance for junction discovery and differential expression profiling and compare it to microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) data using complementary metrics. At all sequencing depths, we discover unannotated exon-exon junctions, with {\textgreater}80{\%} validated by qPCR. We find that measurements of relative expression are accurate and reproducible across sites and platforms if specific filters are used. In contrast, RNA-seq and microarrays do not provide accurate absolute measurements, and gene-specific biases are observed for all examined platforms, including qPCR. Measurement performance depends on the platform and data analysis pipeline, and variation is large for transcript-level profiling. The complete SEQC data sets, comprising {\textgreater}100 billion reads (10Tb), provide unique resources for evaluating RNA-seq analyses for clinical and regulatory settings.},

abstract = {High-volume sequencing of DNA and RNA is now within reach of any research laboratory and is quickly becoming established as a key research tool. In many workflows, each of the short sequences ("reads") resulting from a sequencing run are first "mapped" (aligned) to a reference sequence to infer the read from which the genomic location derived, a challenging task because of the high data volumes and often large genomes. Existing read mapping software excel in either speed (e.g., BWA, Bowtie, ELAND) or sensitivity (e.g., Novoalign), but not in both. In addition, performance often deteriorates in the presence of sequence variation, particularly so for short insertions and deletions (indels). Here, we present a read mapper, Stampy, which uses a hybrid mapping algorithm and a detailed statistical model to achieve both speed and sensitivity, particularly when reads include sequence variation. This results in a higher useable sequence yield and improved accuracy compared to that of existing software.},

abstract = {DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) on a solid surface during polymerase reaction can decipher many sequences in parallel. We report here a DNA sequencing method that is a hybrid between the Sanger dideoxynucleotide terminating reaction and SBS. In this approach, four nucleotides, modified as reversible terminators by capping the 3'-OH with a small reversible moiety so that they are still recognized by DNA polymerase as substrates, are combined with four cleavable fluorescent dideoxynucleotides to perform SBS. The ratio of the two sets of nucleotides is adjusted as the extension cycles proceed. Sequences are determined by the unique fluorescence emission of each fluorophore on the DNA products terminated by ddNTPs. On removing the 3'-OH capping group from the DNA products generated by incorporating the 3'-O-modified dNTPs and the fluorophore from the DNA products terminated with the ddNTPs, the polymerase reaction reinitiates to continue the sequence determination. By using an azidomethyl group as a chemically reversible capping moiety in the 3'-O-modified dNTPs, and an azido-based cleavable linker to attach the fluorophores to the ddNTPs, we synthesized four 3'-O-azidomethyl-dNTPs and four ddNTP-azidolinker-fluorophores for the hybrid SBS. After sequence determination by fluorescence imaging, the 3'-O-azidomethyl group and the fluorophore attached to the DNA extension product via the azidolinker are efficiently removed by using Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in aqueous solution that is compatible with DNA. Various DNA templates, including those with homopolymer regions, were accurately sequenced with a read length of {\textgreater}30 bases by using this hybrid SBS method on a chip and a four-color fluorescence scanner.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies suggest that common genetic variants explain only a small fraction of heritable risk for common diseases, raising the question of whether rare variants account for a significant fraction of unexplained heritability1,2. While DNA sequencing costs have fallen dramatically3, they remain far from what is necessary for rare and novel variants to be routinely identified at a genome-wide scale in large cohorts. We have therefore sought to develop second- generation methods for targeted sequencing of all protein-coding regions (`exomes'), to reduce costs while enriching for discovery of highly penetrant variants. Here we report on the targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing of the exomes of twelve humans. These include eight HapMap individuals representing three populations4, and four unrelated individuals with a rare dominantly inherited disorder, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS)5. We demonstrate the sensitive and specific identification of rare and common variants in over 300 megabases (Mb) of coding sequence. Using FSS as a proof-of-concept, we show that candidate genes for monogenic disorders can be identified by exome sequencing of a small number of unrelated, affected individuals. This strategy may be extendable to diseases with more complex genetics through larger sample sizes and appropriate weighting of nonsynonymous variants by predicted functional impact.},

We compared whole exome sequencing (WES) with the most recent PCR-free whole genome sequencing (WGS), showing that only the latter is able to provide hitherto unprecedented complete coverage of the coding region of the genome. Thus, from a clinical/technical point of view, WGS is the better WES so that capturing is no longer necessary for the most comprehensive genomic testing of Mendelian disorders.},

abstract = {For next-generation sequencing technologies, sufficient base-pair coverage is the foremost requirement for the reliable detection of genomic variants. We investigated whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) platforms offer improved coverage of coding regions compared with whole-exome sequencing (WES) platforms, and compared single-base coverage for a large set of exome and genome samples. We find that WES platforms have improved considerably in the last years, but at comparable sequencing depth, WGS outperforms WES in terms of covered coding regions. At higher sequencing depth (95x-160x), WES successfully captures 95{\%} of the coding regions with a minimal coverage of 20x, compared with 98{\%} for WGS at 87-fold coverage. Three different assessments of sequence coverage bias showed consistent biases for WES but not for WGS. We found no clear differences for the technologies concerning their ability to achieve complete coverage of 2,759 clinically relevant genes. We show that WES performs comparable to WGS in terms of covered bases if sequenced at two to three times higher coverage. This does, however, go at the cost of substantially more sequencing biases in WES approaches. Our findings will guide laboratories to make an informed decision on which sequencing platform and coverage to choose.},

abstract = {Since the completion of the human genome project in 2003, extraordinary progress has been made in genome sequencing technologies, which has led to a decreased cost per megabase and an increase in the number and diversity of sequenced genomes. An astonishing complexity of genome architecture has been revealed, bringing these sequencing technologies to even greater advancements. Some approaches maximize the number of bases sequenced in the least amount of time, generating a wealth of data that can be used to understand increasingly complex phenotypes. Alternatively, other approaches now aim to sequence longer contiguous pieces of DNA, which are essential for resolving structurally complex regions. These and other strategies are providing researchers and clinicians a variety of tools to probe genomes in greater depth, leading to an enhanced understanding of how genome sequence variants underlie phenotype and disease.},

The previously unimaginable scale and economy of these methods, coupled with their enthusiastic uptake by the scientific community and the potential for further improvements in accuracy and read length, suggest that these technologies are destined to make a huge and ongoing impact upon genomic and post-genomic biology. However, like the analysis of microarray data and the assembly and annotation of complete genome sequences from conventional sequencing data, the management and analysis of next-generation sequencing data requires (and indeed has already driven) the development of informatics tools able to assemble, map, and interpret huge quantities of relatively or extremely short nucleotide sequence data.

The increased efficiency of DNA sequencing opens up the possibility of analyzing a large number of individual genomes and transcriptomes, and complete reference proteomes and metabolomes are within reach using powerful analytical techniques based on chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Computational and mathematical tools have enabled the development of systems approaches for deciphering the functional and regulatory networks underlying the behavior of complex biological systems. Further conceptual and methodological developments of these tools are needed for the integration of various data types across the multiple levels of organization and time frames that are characteristic of human development, physiology and disease. Medical genomics has attempted to overcome the initial limitations of genome-wide association studies and has identified a limited number of susceptibility loci for many complex and common diseases. Iterative systems approaches are starting to provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of human diseases, and to facilitate the development of better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for cancer and many other diseases. Systems approaches will transform the way drugs are developed through academy-industry partnerships that will target multiple components of networks and pathways perturbed in diseases. They will enable medicine to become predictive, personalized, preventive and participatory, and, in the process, concepts and methods from Western and oriental cultures can be combined.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The cancer transcriptome is difficult to explore due to the heterogeneity of quantitative and qualitative changes in gene expression linked to the disease status. An increasing number of "unconventional" transcripts, such as novel isoforms, non-coding RNAs, somatic gene fusions and deletions have been associated with the tumoral state. Massively parallel sequencing techniques provide a framework for exploring the transcriptional complexity inherent to cancer with a limited laboratory and financial effort. We developed a deep sequencing and bioinformatics analysis protocol to investigate the molecular composition of a breast cancer poly(A)+ transcriptome. This method utilizes a cDNA library normalization step to diminish the representation of highly expressed transcripts and biology-oriented bioinformatic analyses to facilitate detection of rare and novel transcripts. RESULTS We analyzed over 132,000 Roche 454 high-confidence deep sequencing reads from a primary human lobular breast cancer tissue specimen, and detected a range of unusual transcriptional events that were subsequently validated by RT-PCR in additional eight primary human breast cancer samples. We identified and validated one deletion, two novel ncRNAs (one intergenic and one intragenic), ten previously unknown or rare transcript isoforms and a novel gene fusion specific to a single primary tissue sample. We also explored the non-protein-coding portion of the breast cancer transcriptome, identifying thousands of novel non-coding transcripts and more than three hundred reads corresponding to the non-coding RNA MALAT1, which is highly expressed in many human carcinomas. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate that combining 454 deep sequencing with a normalization step and careful bioinformatic analysis facilitates the discovery and quantification of rare transcripts or ncRNAs, and can be used as a qualitative tool to characterize transcriptome complexity, revealing many hitherto unknown transcripts, splice isoforms, gene fusion events and ncRNAs, even at a relatively low sequence sampling.},

abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in human genomics have allowed unprecedented productivity in terms of algorithms, software, and literature available for translating raw next-generation sequence data into high-quality information. The challenges of variant identification in organisms with lower quality reference genomes are less well documented. We explored the consequences of commonly recommended preparatory steps and the effects of single and multi sample variant identification methods using four publicly available software applications (Platypus, HaplotypeCaller, Samtools and UnifiedGenotyper) on whole genome sequence data of 65 key ancestors of Swiss dairy cattle populations. Accuracy of calling next-generation sequence variants was assessed by comparison to the same loci from medium and high-density single nucleotide variant (SNV) arrays.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: The total number of SNVs identified varied by software and method, with single (multi) sample results ranging from 17.7 to 22.0 (16.9 to 22.0) million variants. Computing time varied considerably between software. Preparatory realignment of insertions and deletions and subsequent base quality score recalibration had only minor effects on the number and quality of SNVs identified by different software, but increased computing time considerably. Average concordance for single (multi) sample results with high-density chip data was 58.3{\{}{\%}{\}} (87.0{\{}{\%}{\}}) and average genotype concordance in correctly identified SNVs was 99.2{\{}{\%}{\}} (99.2{\{}{\%}{\}}) across software. The average quality of SNVs identified, measured as the ratio of transitions to transversions, was higher using single sample methods than multi sample methods. A consensus approach using results of different software generally provided the highest variant quality in terms of transition/transversion ratio.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings serve as a reference for variant identification pipeline development in non-human organisms and help assess the implication of preparatory steps in next-generation sequencing pipelines for organisms with incomplete reference genomes (pipeline code is included). Benchmarking this information should prove particularly useful in processing next-generation sequencing data for use in genome-wide association studies and genomic selection.},

abstract = {Effective use of the human and mouse genomes requires reliable identification of genes and their products. Although multiple public resources provide annotation, different methods are used that can result in similar but not identical representation of genes, transcripts, and proteins. The collaborative consensus coding sequence (CCDS) project tracks identical protein annotations on the reference mouse and human genomes with a stable identifier (CCDS ID), and ensures that they are consistently represented on the NCBI, Ensembl, and UCSC Genome Browsers. Importantly, the project coordinates on manually reviewing inconsistent protein annotations between sites, as well as annotations for which new evidence suggests a revision is needed, to progressively converge on a complete protein-coding set for the human and mouse reference genomes, while maintaining a high standard of reliability and biological accuracy. To date, the project has identified 20,159 human and 17,707 mouse consensus coding regions from 17,052 human and 16,893 mouse genes. Three evaluation methods indicate that the entries in the CCDS set are highly likely to represent real proteins, more so than annotations from contributing groups not included in CCDS. The CCDS database thus centralizes the function of identifying well-supported, identically-annotated, protein-coding regions.},

abstract = {Significance: The colonization of wounds by specific microbes or communities of microbes may delay healing and/or lead to infection-related complication. Studies of wound-associated microbial communities (microbiomes) to date have primarily relied upon culture-based methods, which are known to have extreme biases and are not reliable for the characterization of microbiomes. Biofilms are very resistant to culture and are therefore especially difficult to study with techniques that remain standard in clinical settings. Recent Advances: Culture-independent approaches employing next-generation DNA sequencing have provided researchers and clinicians a window into wound-associated microbiomes that could not be achieved before and has begun to transform our view of wound-associated biodiversity. Within the past decade, many platforms have arisen for performing this type of sequencing, with various types of applications for microbiome research being possible on each. Critical Issues: Wound care incorporating knowledge of microbiomes gained from next-generation sequencing could guide clinical management and treatments. The purpose of this review is to outline the current platforms, their applications, and the steps necessary to undertake microbiome studies using next-generation sequencing. Future Directions: As DNA sequencing technology progresses, platforms will continue to produce longer reads and more reads per run at lower costs. A major future challenge is to implement these technologies in clinical settings for more precise and rapid identification of wound bioburden.},

abstract = {Largely because of efforts required to complete the Human Genome Project, DNA sequencing has undergone a steady transformation with still-ongoing developments of high-throughput sequencing machines for which the cost per reaction is falling drastically. Similarly, the fast-changing landscape of reproductive technologies has been improved by genetic approaches. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis and screening were established more than two decades ago for selecting genetically normal embryos to avoid inherited diseases and to give the highest potential to achieve stable pregnancies. Most recent additions to the IVF practices (blastocyst/trophectoderm biopsy, embryo vitrification) and adoption of new genetics tools such as array comparative genome hybridization have allowed setting up more precise and efficient programs for clinical embryo diagnosis. Nevertheless, there is always room for improvements. Remarkably, a recent explosion in the release of advanced sequencing benchtop platforms, together with a certain maturity of bioinformatics tools, has set the target goal of sequencing individual cells for embryo diagnosis to be a realistically feasible scenario for the near future. Next-generation sequencing technology should provide the opportunity to simultaneously analyze single-gene disorders and perform an extensive comprehensive chromosome screening/diagnosis by concurrently sequencing, counting, and accurately assembling millions of DNA reads.

Based on the gold standard reference variant calls from GIAB, we compared the performance of thirteen variant calling pipelines, testing combinations of three read aligners-BWA-MEM, Bowtie2, and Novoalign-and four variant callers-Genome Analysis Tool Kit HaplotypeCaller (GATK-HC), Samtools mpileup, Freebayes and Ion Proton Variant Caller (TVC), for twelve data sets for the NA12878 genome sequenced by different platforms including Illumina2000, Illumina2500, and Ion Proton, with various exome capture systems and exome coverage. We observed different biases toward specific types of SNP genotyping errors by the different variant callers. The results of our study provide useful guidelines for reliable variant identification from deep sequencing of personal genomes.},

In this study, we use the NIST Genome in a Bottle results as a novel resource for validation of our exome analysis pipeline. We use six different aligners and five different variant callers to determine which pipeline, of the 30 total, performs the best on a human exome that was used to help generate the list of variants detected by the Genome in a Bottle Consortium. Of these 30 pipelines, we found that Novoalign in conjunction with GATK UnifiedGenotyper exhibited the highest sensitivity while maintaining a low number of false positives for SNVs. However, it is apparent that indels are still difficult for any pipeline to handle with none of the tools achieving an average sensitivity higher than 33{\%} or a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) higher than 53{\%}. Lastly, as expected, it was found that aligners can play as vital a role in variant detection as variant callers themselves.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Variant annotation is a crucial step in the analysis of genome sequencing data. Functional annotation results can have a strong influence on the ultimate conclusions of disease studies. Incorrect or incomplete annotations can cause researchers both to overlook potentially disease-relevant DNA variants and to dilute interesting variants in a pool of false positives. Researchers are aware of these issues in general, but the extent of the dependency of final results on the choice of transcripts and software used for annotation has not been quantified in detail. METHODS This paper quantifies the extent of differences in annotation of 80 million variants from a whole-genome sequencing study. We compare results using the RefSeq and Ensembl transcript sets as the basis for variant annotation with the software Annovar, and also compare the results from two annotation software packages, Annovar and VEP (Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor), when using Ensembl transcripts. RESULTS We found only 44{\%} agreement in annotations for putative loss-of-function variants when using the RefSeq and Ensembl transcript sets as the basis for annotation with Annovar. The rate of matching annotations for loss-of-function and nonsynonymous variants combined was 79{\%} and for all exonic variants it was 83{\%}. When comparing results from Annovar and VEP using Ensembl transcripts, matching annotations were seen for only 65{\%} of loss-of-function variants and 87{\%} of all exonic variants, with splicing variants revealed as the category with the greatest discrepancy. Using these comparisons, we characterised the types of apparent errors made by Annovar and VEP and discuss their impact on the analysis of DNA variants in genome sequencing studies. CONCLUSIONS Variant annotation is not yet a solved problem. Choice of transcript set can have a large effect on the ultimate variant annotations obtained in a whole-genome sequencing study. Choice of annotation software can also have a substantial effect. The annotation step in the analysis of a genome sequencing study must therefore be considered carefully, and a conscious choice made as to which transcript set and software are used for annotation.},

@article{Zhao2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND RNA-Seq has become increasingly popular in transcriptome profiling. One aspect of transcriptome research is to quantify the expression levels of genomic elements, such as genes, their transcripts and exons. Acquiring a transcriptome expression profile requires genomic elements to be defined in the context of the genome. Multiple human genome annotation databases exist, including RefGene (RefSeq Gene), Ensembl, and the UCSC annotation database. The impact of the choice of an annotation on estimating gene expression remains insufficiently investigated. RESULTS In this paper, we systematically characterized the impact of genome annotation choice on read mapping and transcriptome quantification by analyzing a RNA-Seq dataset generated by the Human Body Map 2.0 Project. The impact of a gene model on mapping of non-junction reads is different from junction reads. For the RNA-Seq dataset with a read length of 75 bp, on average, 95{\%} of non-junction reads were mapped to exactly the same genomic location regardless of which gene models was used. By contrast, this percentage dropped to 53{\%} for junction reads. In addition, about 30{\%} of junction reads failed to align without the assistance of a gene model, while 10-15{\%} mapped alternatively. There are 21,958 common genes among RefGene, Ensembl, and UCSC annotations. When we compared the gene quantification results in RefGene and Ensembl annotations, 20{\%} of genes are not expressed, and thus have a zero count in both annotations. Surprisingly, identical gene quantification results were obtained for only 16.3{\%} (about one sixth) of genes. Approximately 28.1{\%} of genes' expression levels differed by 5{\%} or higher, and of those, the relative expression levels for 9.3{\%} of genes (equivalent to 2038) differed by 50{\%} or greater. The case studies revealed that the gene definition differences in gene models frequently result in inconsistency in gene quantification. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that the choice of a gene model has a dramatic effect on both gene quantification and differential analysis. Our research will help RNA-Seq data analysts to make an informed choice of gene model in practical RNA-Seq data analysis.},

abstract = {The tertiary structure of the DNA that makes up the eukaryotic genome is remarkably plastic, taking many different forms in response to the different needs of the cell. During the cell cycle of one cell, the DNA is replicated, reorganized into mitotic chromosomes, and decondensed into interphase chromatin. Within one cell at any given point in time, the chromatin is divided into hetero- and euchromatin reflecting active and inactive states of the DNA. This organization varies within one organism since different parts of the genome are active in different cell types. This article focuses on the most dramatic cell-type-specific DNA organization, that found in spermatozoa, in which the entire genome is reorganized into an inactive state that is more highly condensed than mitotic chromosomes. This unique example of eukaryotic DNA organization offers some interesting clues to the still unanswered questions about the role that the three-dimensional packaging of DNA plays in its function.},

abstract = {Autoradiographic procedures for the study of RNA and protein synthesis during spermatogenesis have been complemented with electron microscope techniques for visualization of gene activity. These procedures have enabled us to determine that RNA transcription is highly selective with respect to RNA species, timing of synthesis, types of chromosomes (autosomes and sex chromosomes), segments of chromosomes (i.e., the lampbrush segment), and chromatin structure. In mouse and human spermatocytes, a peak production of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) occurs during leptotene-zygotene, preceding nonnucleolar RNA synthesis, which is at a peak in middle pachytene. Transcription in late spermatids decreases in coincidence with changes in chromatin structure and high incorporation rates of [3H]arginine. In these cells, a particulate repeating pattern of chromatin is replaced by chromatin fibers of uniform diameter as highly arginine-rich proteins replace somatic histones. In spermatogonia, spermatocytes and Sertoli cells, the products of transcription are mainly heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) and rRNA, whereas spermatids transcribe predominantly hnRNA during early spermiogenesis. Persistent long-lived [3H]-uridine-labeled RNA species in pachytene spermatocyte nuclei contrast with a fast turnover of [3H]uridine-labeled RNA in Sertoli cells as detected at the same pulse labeling time (8--12 days). From these results one can postulate a still undefined control mechanism of gene expression during spermatogenesis for modulating a cascade of events required for male gamete formation.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Critical review of the literature. RESULT(S) Sperm from normospermic, fertile men have epigenetic modifications consistent with gene "poising" at the promoters of genes involved in development, including the localization of retained histones with bivalent histone modifications and hypomethylation of DNA. These epigenetic marks are altered in some patients with abnormal spermatogenesis, and in some men who exhibit unexplained, altered embryogenesis during IVF therapy. CONCLUSION(S) The sperm epigenome implies a poising of the paternal genome for embryogenesis and a possible role in the establishment of totipotency of the embryo and may help in understanding some causes of reduced fertility and transmission of disease risk.},

abstract = {Recent work in the field of male fertility has yielded significant increases in our understanding of the sperm epigenome and its potential role in embryonic development. These new findings have enabled a broad classification of a normal epigenetic state in the male gamete and have provided insight into the possible etiologies of some idiopathic male infertility cases. Histone retention and modification, protamine incorporation into the chromatin, DNA methylation, and spermatozoal RNA transcripts appear to play important roles in the epigenetic state of mature sperm. These epigenetic factors may reveal a historical record of spermatogenesis, portend future functions in embryogenesis, and help to elucidate mechanism of pluripotency. In contrast to the once held dogma regarding the importance of the paternal epigenome, the unique epigenetic landscape in sperm appears to serve more than the gamete itself and is likely influential in the developing embryo. In fact, growing evidence suggests that mature sperm provide appropriate epigenetic marks that drive specific genes toward activation and contribute to the pluripotent state of the embryonic cells. Although not definitive, the current literature provides evidence for the role of the sperm epigenome in the embryo. Future work must be focused on the characterization of epigenetic abnormalities commonly found in individuals with compromised fertility to further establish this role. Additionally, studies should target the effects of environment and aging on the sperm epigenetic program and subsequent fertility loss to determine the etiology of aberrant epigenetic profiles.},

abstract = {The fibrous sheath (FS) is a novel structural feature in the principal piece region of the sperm flagellum in marsupial and eutherian mammals. It begins anteriorly at the annulus, is composed of two longitudinal columns connected by circumferential ribs, and surrounds the outer dense fibers in the principal piece. The formation of the FS was described eloquently nearly twenty-five years ago, but the identification of its components has occurred only during the last few years. Most of the genes encoding the known FS components are expressed during the postmeiotic period of spermatogenesis, are expressed only in spermatogenic cells, and are either novel genes or paralogues of genes expressed in somatic cells. The proteins of the FS can be classified in nine categories based on their functional or structural roles. Most of these are resistant to solubilization and remain in the FS during rigorous isolation procedures. Mouse sperm with a knock out of the gene encoding GAPDHS are immotile, which demonstrates that most of the ATP needed for sperm motility is generated by glycolysis. Most of the glycolytic enzymes have been localised to the principal piece and some are tightly associated with the FS. However, the nature of the protein-protein interactions involved in assembly and maintenance of FS are known for only a few of the component proteins.},

abstract = {The details of a new fixation procedure using 40 per cent osmium tetroxide in carbon tetrachloride are presented. This fixative is a good general preservative, gives a higher contrast than the ordinary osmium fixatives, and may also preserve structures that are not otherwise readily revealed. Some possible reasons for the increased contrast are discussed. Micrographs of the sea urchin spermatozoa treated with the new fixative provide more detailed information on the tail structure than has heretofore been obtainable. This information is summarized in the diagrammatic text-figure. The sperm tail can no longer be regarded as having a bilateral symmetry, and thus, it is possible to assign an index number to each of the nine peripheral filaments. The nine peripheral filaments have a complex morphology, each one of them seems to be composed of two subunits that have unequal diameters. The slightly larger subunits are all found in the clockwise direction with regard to the other subunit or are all found in the counter-clockwise direction in the sectioned tail. Each of the slightly larger subunits is at intervals provided with two types of projections-referred to as the arms and the spokes-that extend in respective tangential and radial direction. The arms from one filament may be in actual contact with its neighboring filament through a complex bridge-like formation. There is a quantitative difference between the nine filaments with regard to this bridge. It is assumed that the eleven tail filaments follow straight paths. Some hypotheses on sperm movement are discussed based on this assumption and on the fact that the oscillations of an actively working sperm tail are in one plane. Probably, the nine peripheral filaments have non-equivalent functions in tail movement. In the centriole the nine peripheral filaments characteristically appear as triplets in a whorl-like arrangement. It is suggested that the inner part of this triplet is a derivation of the arms. A structural abnormality of the tail is described that is characterized by two or three complete sets of tail filaments within one cell membrane.},

abstract = {Abstract Sperm motility is generated by a highly organized, microtubule-based structure, called the axoneme, which is constructed from approximately 250 proteins. Recent studies have revealed the molecular structures and functions of a number of axonemal components, including the motor molecules, the dyneins, and regulatory substructures, such as radial spoke, central pair, and other accessory structures. The force for flagellar movement is exerted by the sliding of outer-doublet microtubules driven by the molecular motors, the dyneins. Dynein activity is regulated by the radial spoke/central pair apparatus through protein phosphorylation, resulting in flagellar bend propagation. Prior to fertilization, sperm exhibit dramatic motility changes, such as initiation and activation of motility and chemotaxis toward the egg. These changes are triggered by changes in the extracellular ionic environment and substances released from the female reproductive tract or egg. After reception of these extracellular signa...},

Many mammals have one protamine, but a few species, including humans and mice, have two. Here we use gene targeting to determine if the second protamine provides redundancy to an essential process, or if both protamines are necessary. We disrupted the coding sequence of one allele of either Prm1 or Prm2 in embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from 129-strain mice, and injected them into blastocysts from C57BL/6-strain mice. Male chimeras produced 129-genotype sperm with disrupted Prm1 or Prm2 alleles, but failed to sire offspring carrying the 129 genome. We also found that a decrease in the amount of either protamine disrupts nuclear formation, processing of protamine-2 and normal sperm function. Our studies show that both protamines are essential and that haploinsufficiency caused by a mutation in one allele of Prm1 or Prm2 prevents genetic transmission of both mutant and wild-type alleles.},

abstract = {Spermiogenesis constitutes the steps involved in the metamorphosis of spermatids into spermatozoa. It involves modification of several organelles in addition to the formation of several structures including the flagellum and cytoplasmic droplet. The flagellum is composed of a neck region and middle, principal, and end pieces. The axoneme composed of nine outer microtubular doublets circularly arranged to form a cylinder around a central pair of microtubules is present throughout the flagellum. The middle and principal pieces each contain specific components such as the mitochondrial sheath and fibrous sheath, respectively, while outer dense fibers are common to both. A plethora of proteins are constituents of each of these structures, with each playing key roles in functions related to the fertility of spermatozoa. At the end of spermiogenesis, a portion of spermatid cytoplasm remains associated with the released spermatozoa, referred to as the cytoplasmic droplet. The latter has as its main feature Golgi saccules, which appear to modify the plasma membrane of spermatozoa as they move down the epididymal duct and hence may be partly involved in male gamete maturation. The end product of spermatogenesis is highly streamlined and motile spermatozoa having a condensed nucleus equipped with an acrosome. Spermatozoa move through the female reproductive tract and eventually penetrate the zona pellucida and bind to the egg plasma membrane. Many proteins have been implicated in the process of fertilization as well as a plethora of proteins involved in the development of spermatids and sperm, and these are high lighted in this review.},

However, when mouse spermatids were fused with oocytes, some of the resulting zygotes developed into normal fertile mice of either sex. This demonstrates that the nuclei of spermatids can provide the paternally imprinted chromosomes needed for full embryonic development and also that the complex postmeiotic modifications involved in sperm formation in the testis and their maturation in the epididymis merely serve to facilitate natural delivery of the paternal genome. This finding may find an application in the treatment of male infertility due to defective spermiogenesis/sperm maturation.},

abstract = {Genomic imprinting occurs in both male and female gametes during gametogenesis, but the exact time when imprinting begins and ends is unknown. In the present study we injected nuclei of testicular spermatozoa and round spermatids into mature mouse oocytes to see whether these nuclei are able to participate in syngamy and normal embryonic development. If the injected oocytes develop into normal fertile offspring, imprinting in the male germ cells used must have been completed by the time of injection. Ninety-two percent of mouse oocytes injected with testicular spermatozoa survived and 94{\%} of these were fertilized normally (extrusion of the second polar body and formation of male and female pronuclei). When 44 two-cell embryos so created were transferred to 5 foster mothers, 24 (54.5{\%}) developed into normal offspring. Unlike testicular spermatozoa, round spermatids could not activate the oocytes, and therefore the oocytes had to be activated artificially either before or after spermatid injection. The highest rate (77{\%}) of normal fertilization was obtained when the oocytes were first activated by electric current, then injected individually with a single spermatid nucleus. When 131 two-cell embryos were transferred to 15 foster mothers, 37 (28.2{\%}) reached full term. All but two grew into healthy adults. Thus, it would appear that gametic imprinting in mouse spermatogenic cells is completed before spermiogenesis begins. Under the experimental conditions employed, spermatid nuclei were less efficient than testicular sperm nuclei in producing normal offspring, but perhaps this was due to technical rather than inherent problems.},

abstract = {Round spermatids, precursor male gametes, are known to possess the potential to achieve fertilization and embryonic development when injected into eggs. However, injection of spermatids alone seldom activates eggs in the mouse, as spermatids by themselves cannot induce an increase in intracellular Ca2+, a prerequisite for egg activation. We injected a mouse round spermatid into an egg simultaneously with partially purified sperm factor from differentiated hamster spermatozoa. The combined injection produced repetitive Ca2+ increases (Ca2+ oscillations) lasting for at least 4 h as observed at fertilization, and induced activation in 92{\%} of eggs. This method provided 75{\%} fertilization success associated with male and female pronucleus formation and development to 2-cell embryos, while only 7{\%} of eggs were fertilized by injection of a spermatid alone. Of the 2-cell embryos, approximately 50{\%} developed to blastocysts during 5 days of culture in vitro, while no blastocysts were obtained following injection of sperm factor alone. Furthermore, the 2-cell embryos, that were created by spermatids and sperm factor and transplanted into foster mothers, developed into normal offspring, although the percentage was only 22{\%}. All infants grew into healthy adults carrying normal chromosomes. The sperm factor served as a complementary factor for successful fertilization by round spermatid injection.},

The high reproducibility of the smear quantification permits the introduction of a number of indices, defining clinically useful relations between cell types that are indicative of various types of infertility. The data obtained by cytologic quantification showed reasonably good correlation with the histologic diagnoses of desquamation and focal fibrosis and excellent correlation with Sertoli cells only, arrested spermatogenesis and complete fibrosis.

abstract = {Testicular biopsies were obtained at various intervals after intra-testicular injections of tritiated thymidine. Radioautographs revealed that the most mature labeled germ cells were the preleptotene spermatocytes at 1 hour, the midpachytene spermatocytes at 16 days, and the immature spermatids at 32 days after injection. These results indicated that one cycle of the seminiferous epithelium lasts 16 days, and the whole of spermatogenesis is estimated to con-sume approximately 64 days. In sharp contrast to other mammalian species, the arrangement of germ cells in the human seminiferous epithelium appears to be and always has been con-sidered chaotic. No clearcut cellular association could, until recently, be identified and the "cycle of the semi-niferous epithelium" in man was said to be nonexistent. This lack of organi-zation would obviously hinder any eval-uation of the rate of development of the germinal elements. Recently Cler-mont (1) determined the composition of six typical cellular associations and described the cyclic evolution of the seminiferous epithelium in man. These findings were confirmed and applied to studies on the effects of diamines on human spermatogenesis (2). These cellular relations have been used in the present investigation to obtain an esti-mate of the duration of spermatogenesis. In a few mammals, spermatogenesis, the process by which spermatogonial stem cells proliferate and transform into spermatozoa, has been accurately timed by labeling resting (also called pre-leptotene) spermatocytes with a DNA precursor and radioautographing sec-tions of testis at various time intervals},

Proteins from the septin family have been shown to localize to the annulus. A septin complex is assembled early in spermiogenesis with the cochaperone DNAJB13 and, in mature sperm, associates with Testis Anion Transporter 1; SLC26A8 (Tat1), a transmembrane protein of the SLC26 family. Studies in mice have shown that the annulus acts as a barrier to protein diffusion and controls correct organization of the midpiece. Consistent with these findings, absence of the annulus is associated with flagellum differentiation defects and asthenozoospermia in humans.},

abstract = {The physiological function of spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and mammals is to produce spermatozoa (1n, haploid) that contain only half of the genetic material of spermatogonia (2n, diploid). This half number of chromosomes from a spermatozoon will then be reconstituted to become a diploid cell upon fertilization with an egg, which is also haploid. Thus, genetic information from two parental individuals can be passed onto their offspring. Spermatogenesis takes place in the seminiferous epithelium of the seminiferous tubule, the functional unit of the mammalian testis. In mammals, particularly in rodents, the fascinating morphological changes that occur during spermatogenesis involving cellular differentiation and transformation, mitosis, meiosis, germ cell movement, spermiogenesis and spermiation have been well documented from the 1950s through the 1980s. During this time, however, the regulation of, as well as the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse cellular events occurring throughout spermatogenesis, have remained largely unexplored. In the past two decades, important advancements have been made using new biochemical, cell and molecular biology techniques to understand how different genes, proteins and signalling pathways regulate various aspects of spermatogenesis. These include studies on the differentiation of spermatogonia from gonocytes; regulation of spermatogonial stem cells; regulation of spermatogonial mitosis; regulation of meiosis, spermiogenesis and spermiation; role of hormones (e.g. oestrogens, androgens) in spermatogenesis; transcriptional regulation of spermatogenesis; regulation of apoptosis; cell-cell interactions; and the biology of junction dynamics during spermatogenesis. The impact of environmental toxicants on spermatogenesis has also become an urgent issue in the field in light of declining fertility levels in males. Many of these studies have helped investigators to understand important similarities, differences and evolutionary relationships between C. elegans, D. melanogaster and mammals relating to spermatogenesis. In this Special Issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, we have covered many of these areas, and in this Introduction, we highlight the topic of spermatogenesis by examining its past, present and future.},

abstract = {Proacrosin biosynthesis timing during human spermatogenesis has been studied using the monoclonal antibody 4D4 (mAb 4D4). Frozen and paraffin-embedded sections of testicular biopsies were labelled by standard indirect immunofluorescence and avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase procedures. The labelling specificity was checked by immunochemistry assays on unrelated tissues and by western blotting of testis extracts showing that only the 50-55 x 10(3) Mr proacrosin was recognized by mAb 4D4. Proacrosin was first observed in the Golgi region of midpachytene primary spermatocytes. In late pachytene primary spermatocytes, proacrosin was observed in two regions located at opposite nuclear poles. During the subsequent steps of the first meiotic division, the two bodies containing proacrosin were located: (i) on opposite sides of the equatorial plate during metaphase; (ii) along the microtubular spindle during anaphase; and (iii) close to each chromosomal aggregate during telophase. Two bodies containing proacrosin were still observed in interphasic secondary spermatocytes. The single labelled area observed in early spermatids was found to increase considerably in size during spermiogenesis. Anomalies of proacrosin scattering were observed in patients with Golgi complex partitioning failure. These data reveal proacrosin biosynthesis during diploid and haploid phases of human spermatogenesis and the proacrosin partitioning pattern during meiosis.},

Many of the changes are associated with the acquisition of the capacity to support post-fertilization development. Our knowledge of this aspect has greatly increased- for example, insights into how the re-establishment of parental imprints is regulated. In addition, an emerging theme from recent studies is that epigenetic modifiers have key roles in germ-cell development itself--for example, epigenetics contributes to the gene-expression programme that is required for germ-cell development, regulation of meiosis and genomic integrity. Understanding epigenetic regulation in germ cells has implications for reproductive engineering technologies and human health.},

abstract = {The primary function of the mammalian testis is the production of both gametes and hormones over a reproductive lifespan. This production of gametes proceeds in the seminiferous tubules and is supported by a stem cell population, the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Like other tissue-specific stem cells, SSCs are defined by their ability to balance between self-renewal and differentiation. This balance maintains the stem cell pool and guarantees the daily production of spermatozoa from puberty onward. Studying SSCs is difficult because they are very few in number (0.03{\%} of all germ cells), and specific markers have not been identified so far. Most of our knowledge results from experiments in rodent models. Very little is known about human SSCs. This review provides an update on SSCs, on their role in male fertility, and on (future) clinical applications using these fascinating cells.},

abstract = {Based on enumeration of maturation-phase spermatids in testicular homogenates from adult men and rats, daily sperm production per gram of testicular parenchyma (DSP/g) was almost seven times greater in rats (21.1 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.9 x 106 vs 3.1 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.5 x 106 ; x {\{}+/-{\}} SEM, n = 10). The relative inefficiency of the human testis was uniformly expressed in cranial, equatorial and caudal regions. Furthermore, DSP/g was highly correlated between paired testes from individual men (r = +0.97, n = 10), and differences between paired testes were not significantly different from zero (P{\textgreater}0.4). Histometric analysis of glutaraldehyde-perfused testes revealed differences (P{\textless}0.05) in relative testicular compositions between humans and rats (n = 3) including higher proportions of parenchyma, seminiferous tubules, seminiferous epithelium and germinal cells in the rat testis. Humans exceeded rats only in the proportions of testis occupied by nongerminal components such as tunic, interstitium, tubule boundary tissue and Sertoli cells. Histometric determination of the proportion of the testicular parenchyma occupied by these nuclei and consideration of average volume of round spermatid nuclei yielded DSP/g estimates of 17.4 {\{}+/-{\}} 1.8 x 106 in rats (not significantly different from the result by the homogenization method) and 8.5 {\{}+/-{\}} 1.3 x 106 in humans (almost three times higher than the value obtained by the homogenization method). Although the disparity between values for human DSP/g obtained by the two methods cannot yet be explained, several lines of evidence suggest that the time divisor used for human material processed by the homogenization method is too long, thus yielding an underestimation of daily sperm production. While its absolute accuracy is questionable, the homogenization method remains a rapid and precise technique for estimating DSP/g in humans. Histometric analysis and histometric estimation of DSP/g support the concept that the human is less efficient in sperm production than the rat, but these methods suggest that the rat is only about twice as efficient per gram of testicular parenchyma as the human.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The kinetics of spermatogenesis in mammals are reviewed with special emphasis on the seminiferous epithelium cycle and spermatogonial renewal .  2 features of the spermatogenic process are that for a given species each step of spermatogenesis has a constant duration and that many spermatogonial stem cells enter spermatogenesis simultaneously and almost synchronously.  The seminiferous epithelium composed of 5 or 6 generations of germ cells form cellular associations of fixed compositi on.  Spermatids at a given step of spermiogenesis are always associated with spermatocytes and spermatogonia at given steps of development.  These cellular groupings were taken to represent stages of a cycle of the seminferous epithelium.  The number of stages composing the cycle vary with the species and the criteria used to characterize them.  The classifications of cell associations are particulary useful in investigations of the mode of renewal of the spermatogonial population.  The stem cells that belong to the Type A category may be classified as "reserve" and "renewing" stem cells.  The former appear to be actively involved in the production of spermatocytes in normal adult animals but the latter initiate at each cycle of the seminiferous epithelium a series of mitoses during which they renew themselves and  simultaneously give rise to "differentiating" spermatogonia.  The "nodal" or key mitosis that result appear to be equivalent in type and not bivalent.},
