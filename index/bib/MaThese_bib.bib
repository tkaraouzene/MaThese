abstract = {Spermiogenesis constitutes the steps involved in the metamorphosis of spermatids into spermatozoa. It involves modification of several organelles in addition to the formation of several structures including the flagellum and cytoplasmic droplet. The flagellum is composed of a neck region and middle, principal, and end pieces. The axoneme composed of nine outer microtubular doublets circularly arranged to form a cylinder around a central pair of microtubules is present throughout the flagellum. The middle and principal pieces each contain specific components such as the mitochondrial sheath and fibrous sheath, respectively, while outer dense fibers are common to both. A plethora of proteins are constituents of each of these structures, with each playing key roles in functions related to the fertility of spermatozoa. At the end of spermiogenesis, a portion of spermatid cytoplasm remains associated with the released spermatozoa, referred to as the cytoplasmic droplet. The latter has as its main feature Golgi saccules, which appear to modify the plasma membrane of spermatozoa as they move down the epididymal duct and hence may be partly involved in male gamete maturation. The end product of spermatogenesis is highly streamlined and motile spermatozoa having a condensed nucleus equipped with an acrosome. Spermatozoa move through the female reproductive tract and eventually penetrate the zona pellucida and bind to the egg plasma membrane. Many proteins have been implicated in the process of fertilization as well as a plethora of proteins involved in the development of spermatids and sperm, and these are high lighted in this review.},

abstract = {Normally, round spermatids, the youngest male germ cells with a set of haploid chromosomes, cannot fertilize mature oocytes. However, when mouse spermatids were fused with oocytes, some of the resulting zygotes developed into normal fertile mice of either sex. This demonstrates that the nuclei of spermatids can provide the paternally imprinted chromosomes needed for full embryonic development and also that the complex postmeiotic modifications involved in sperm formation in the testis and their maturation in the epididymis merely serve to facilitate natural delivery of the paternal genome. This finding may find an application in the treatment of male infertility due to defective spermiogenesis/sperm maturation.},

abstract = {Genomic imprinting occurs in both male and female gametes during gametogenesis, but the exact time when imprinting begins and ends is unknown. In the present study we injected nuclei of testicular spermatozoa and round spermatids into mature mouse oocytes to see whether these nuclei are able to participate in syngamy and normal embryonic development. If the injected oocytes develop into normal fertile offspring, imprinting in the male germ cells used must have been completed by the time of injection. Ninety-two percent of mouse oocytes injected with testicular spermatozoa survived and 94{\%} of these were fertilized normally (extrusion of the second polar body and formation of male and female pronuclei). When 44 two-cell embryos so created were transferred to 5 foster mothers, 24 (54.5{\%}) developed into normal offspring. Unlike testicular spermatozoa, round spermatids could not activate the oocytes, and therefore the oocytes had to be activated artificially either before or after spermatid injection. The highest rate (77{\%}) of normal fertilization was obtained when the oocytes were first activated by electric current, then injected individually with a single spermatid nucleus. When 131 two-cell embryos were transferred to 15 foster mothers, 37 (28.2{\%}) reached full term. All but two grew into healthy adults. Thus, it would appear that gametic imprinting in mouse spermatogenic cells is completed before spermiogenesis begins. Under the experimental conditions employed, spermatid nuclei were less efficient than testicular sperm nuclei in producing normal offspring, but perhaps this was due to technical rather than inherent problems.},

abstract = {Round spermatids, precursor male gametes, are known to possess the potential to achieve fertilization and embryonic development when injected into eggs. However, injection of spermatids alone seldom activates eggs in the mouse, as spermatids by themselves cannot induce an increase in intracellular Ca2+, a prerequisite for egg activation. We injected a mouse round spermatid into an egg simultaneously with partially purified sperm factor from differentiated hamster spermatozoa. The combined injection produced repetitive Ca2+ increases (Ca2+ oscillations) lasting for at least 4 h as observed at fertilization, and induced activation in 92{\%} of eggs. This method provided 75{\%} fertilization success associated with male and female pronucleus formation and development to 2-cell embryos, while only 7{\%} of eggs were fertilized by injection of a spermatid alone. Of the 2-cell embryos, approximately 50{\%} developed to blastocysts during 5 days of culture in vitro, while no blastocysts were obtained following injection of sperm factor alone. Furthermore, the 2-cell embryos, that were created by spermatids and sperm factor and transplanted into foster mothers, developed into normal offspring, although the percentage was only 22{\%}. All infants grew into healthy adults carrying normal chromosomes. The sperm factor served as a complementary factor for successful fertilization by round spermatid injection.},

Spermatogenic cells are round or oval and show scanty cytoplasm with deeper basophilia and well-defined cytoplasmic borders. Multinucleation is common in spermatogenic cells.

Both cell types may occur as naked nuclei. Some problems of cell classification are discussed.},

Identification of the cell types, which are described and illustrated, was consistent and reproducible; the advantages of the different stainings in their analysis is documented. The cell counts were tested for reproducibility and compared to the histologic diagnoses and sperm counts. Statistical analysis showed the highest reproducibility for cells frequently encountered in smears (0.99 for Sertoli cells and 0.98 for spermatozoa) and the lowest but still satisfactory reproducibility for rare or arbitrarily defined cell forms (0.71 for dark spermatogonia and 0.76 for secondary spermatocytes). The high reproducibility of the smear quantification permits the introduction of a number of indices, defining clinically useful relations between cell types that are indicative of various types of infertility. The data obtained by cytologic quantification showed reasonably good correlation with the histologic diagnoses of desquamation and focal fibrosis and excellent correlation with Sertoli cells only, arrested spermatogenesis and complete fibrosis. The cytologic quantification of testicular smears adds considerable information to the diagnosis of impaired fertility and should be instituted in properly equipped centers.},

abstract = {Testicular biopsies were obtained at various intervals after intra-testicular injections of tritiated thymidine. Radioautographs revealed that the most mature labeled germ cells were the preleptotene spermatocytes at 1 hour, the midpachytene spermatocytes at 16 days, and the immature spermatids at 32 days after injection. These results indicated that one cycle of the seminiferous epithelium lasts 16 days, and the whole of spermatogenesis is estimated to con-sume approximately 64 days. In sharp contrast to other mammalian species, the arrangement of germ cells in the human seminiferous epithelium appears to be and always has been con-sidered chaotic. No clearcut cellular association could, until recently, be identified and the "cycle of the semi-niferous epithelium" in man was said to be nonexistent. This lack of organi-zation would obviously hinder any eval-uation of the rate of development of the germinal elements. Recently Cler-mont (1) determined the composition of six typical cellular associations and described the cyclic evolution of the seminiferous epithelium in man. These findings were confirmed and applied to studies on the effects of diamines on human spermatogenesis (2). These cellular relations have been used in the present investigation to obtain an esti-mate of the duration of spermatogenesis. In a few mammals, spermatogenesis, the process by which spermatogonial stem cells proliferate and transform into spermatozoa, has been accurately timed by labeling resting (also called pre-leptotene) spermatocytes with a DNA precursor and radioautographing sec-tions of testis at various time intervals},

abstract = {The physiological function of spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and mammals is to produce spermatozoa (1n, haploid) that contain only half of the genetic material of spermatogonia (2n, diploid). This half number of chromosomes from a spermatozoon will then be reconstituted to become a diploid cell upon fertilization with an egg, which is also haploid. Thus, genetic information from two parental individuals can be passed onto their offspring. Spermatogenesis takes place in the seminiferous epithelium of the seminiferous tubule, the functional unit of the mammalian testis. In mammals, particularly in rodents, the fascinating morphological changes that occur during spermatogenesis involving cellular differentiation and transformation, mitosis, meiosis, germ cell movement, spermiogenesis and spermiation have been well documented from the 1950s through the 1980s. During this time, however, the regulation of, as well as the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse cellular events occurring throughout spermatogenesis, have remained largely unexplored. In the past two decades, important advancements have been made using new biochemical, cell and molecular biology techniques to understand how different genes, proteins and signalling pathways regulate various aspects of spermatogenesis. These include studies on the differentiation of spermatogonia from gonocytes; regulation of spermatogonial stem cells; regulation of spermatogonial mitosis; regulation of meiosis, spermiogenesis and spermiation; role of hormones (e.g. oestrogens, androgens) in spermatogenesis; transcriptional regulation of spermatogenesis; regulation of apoptosis; cell-cell interactions; and the biology of junction dynamics during spermatogenesis. The impact of environmental toxicants on spermatogenesis has also become an urgent issue in the field in light of declining fertility levels in males. Many of these studies have helped investigators to understand important similarities, differences and evolutionary relationships between C. elegans, D. melanogaster and mammals relating to spermatogenesis. In this Special Issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, we have covered many of these areas, and in this Introduction, we highlight the topic of spermatogenesis by examining its past, present and future.},

abstract = {Proacrosin biosynthesis timing during human spermatogenesis has been studied using the monoclonal antibody 4D4 (mAb 4D4). Frozen and paraffin-embedded sections of testicular biopsies were labelled by standard indirect immunofluorescence and avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase procedures. The labelling specificity was checked by immunochemistry assays on unrelated tissues and by western blotting of testis extracts showing that only the 50-55 x 10(3) Mr proacrosin was recognized by mAb 4D4. Proacrosin was first observed in the Golgi region of midpachytene primary spermatocytes. In late pachytene primary spermatocytes, proacrosin was observed in two regions located at opposite nuclear poles. During the subsequent steps of the first meiotic division, the two bodies containing proacrosin were located: (i) on opposite sides of the equatorial plate during metaphase; (ii) along the microtubular spindle during anaphase; and (iii) close to each chromosomal aggregate during telophase. Two bodies containing proacrosin were still observed in interphasic secondary spermatocytes. The single labelled area observed in early spermatids was found to increase considerably in size during spermiogenesis. Anomalies of proacrosin scattering were observed in patients with Golgi complex partitioning failure. These data reveal proacrosin biosynthesis during diploid and haploid phases of human spermatogenesis and the proacrosin partitioning pattern during meiosis.},

abstract = {The epigenetic profile of germ cells, which is defined by modifications of DNA and chromatin, changes dynamically during their development. Many of the changes are associated with the acquisition of the capacity to support post-fertilization development. Our knowledge of this aspect has greatly increased- for example, insights into how the re-establishment of parental imprints is regulated. In addition, an emerging theme from recent studies is that epigenetic modifiers have key roles in germ-cell development itself--for example, epigenetics contributes to the gene-expression programme that is required for germ-cell development, regulation of meiosis and genomic integrity. Understanding epigenetic regulation in germ cells has implications for reproductive engineering technologies and human health.},

@article{Goossens2013,
abstract = {The primary function of the mammalian testis is the production of both gametes and hormones over a reproductive lifespan. This production of gametes proceeds in the seminiferous tubules and is supported by a stem cell population, the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Like other tissue-specific stem cells, SSCs are defined by their ability to balance between self-renewal and differentiation. This balance maintains the stem cell pool and guarantees the daily production of spermatozoa from puberty onward. Studying SSCs is difficult because they are very few in number (0.03{\%} of all germ cells), and specific markers have not been identified so far. Most of our knowledge results from experiments in rodent models. Very little is known about human SSCs. This review provides an update on SSCs, on their role in male fertility, and on (future) clinical applications using these fascinating cells.},

@article{Johnson1980,
abstract = {Based on enumeration of maturation-phase spermatids in testicular homogenates from adult men and rats, daily sperm production per gram of testicular parenchyma (DSP/g) was almost seven times greater in rats (21.1 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.9 x 106 vs 3.1 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.5 x 106 ; x {\{}+/-{\}} SEM, n = 10). The relative inefficiency of the human testis was uniformly expressed in cranial, equatorial and caudal regions. Furthermore, DSP/g was highly correlated between paired testes from individual men (r = +0.97, n = 10), and differences between paired testes were not significantly different from zero (P{\textgreater}0.4). Histometric analysis of glutaraldehyde-perfused testes revealed differences (P{\textless}0.05) in relative testicular compositions between humans and rats (n = 3) including higher proportions of parenchyma, seminiferous tubules, seminiferous epithelium and germinal cells in the rat testis. Humans exceeded rats only in the proportions of testis occupied by nongerminal components such as tunic, interstitium, tubule boundary tissue and Sertoli cells. Histometric determination of the proportion of the testicular parenchyma occupied by these nuclei and consideration of average volume of round spermatid nuclei yielded DSP/g estimates of 17.4 {\{}+/-{\}} 1.8 x 106 in rats (not significantly different from the result by the homogenization method) and 8.5 {\{}+/-{\}} 1.3 x 106 in humans (almost three times higher than the value obtained by the homogenization method). Although the disparity between values for human DSP/g obtained by the two methods cannot yet be explained, several lines of evidence suggest that the time divisor used for human material processed by the homogenization method is too long, thus yielding an underestimation of daily sperm production. While its absolute accuracy is questionable, the homogenization method remains a rapid and precise technique for estimating DSP/g in humans. Histometric analysis and histometric estimation of DSP/g support the concept that the human is less efficient in sperm production than the rat, but these methods suggest that the rat is only about twice as efficient per gram of testicular parenchyma as the human.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The kinetics of spermatogenesis in mammals are reviewed with special emphasis on the seminiferous epithelium cycle and spermatogonial renewal .  2 features of the spermatogenic process are that for a given species each step of spermatogenesis has a constant duration and that many spermatogonial stem cells enter spermatogenesis simultaneously and almost synchronously.  The seminiferous epithelium composed of 5 or 6 generations of germ cells form cellular associations of fixed compositi on.  Spermatids at a given step of spermiogenesis are always associated with spermatocytes and spermatogonia at given steps of development.  These cellular groupings were taken to represent stages of a cycle of the seminferous epithelium.  The number of stages composing the cycle vary with the species and the criteria used to characterize them.  The classifications of cell associations are particulary useful in investigations of the mode of renewal of the spermatogonial population.  The stem cells that belong to the Type A category may be classified as "reserve" and "renewing" stem cells.  The former appear to be actively involved in the production of spermatocytes in normal adult animals but the latter initiate at each cycle of the seminiferous epithelium a series of mitoses during which they renew themselves and  simultaneously give rise to "differentiating" spermatogonia.  The "nodal" or key mitosis that result appear to be equivalent in type and not bivalent.},
