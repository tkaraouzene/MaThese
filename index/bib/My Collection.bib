abstract = {The kinetics of spermatogenesis in mammals are reviewed with special emphasis on the seminiferous epithelium cycle and spermatogonial renewal .  2 features of the spermatogenic process are that for a given species each step of spermatogenesis has a constant duration and that many spermatogonial stem cells enter spermatogenesis simultaneously and almost synchronously.  The seminiferous epithelium composed of 5 or 6 generations of germ cells form cellular associations of fixed compositi on.  Spermatids at a given step of spermiogenesis are always associated with spermatocytes and spermatogonia at given steps of development.  These cellular groupings were taken to represent stages of a cycle of the seminferous epithelium.  The number of stages composing the cycle vary with the species and the criteria used to characterize them.  The classifications of cell associations are particulary useful in investigations of the mode of renewal of the spermatogonial population.  The stem cells that belong to the Type A category may be classified as "reserve" and "renewing" stem cells.  The former appear to be actively involved in the production of spermatocytes in normal adult animals but the latter initiate at each cycle of the seminiferous epithelium a series of mitoses during which they renew themselves and  simultaneously give rise to "differentiating" spermatogonia.  The "nodal" or key mitosis that result appear to be equivalent in type and not bivalent.},

abstract = {Based on enumeration of maturation-phase spermatids in testicular homogenates from adult men and rats, daily sperm production per gram of testicular parenchyma (DSP/g) was almost seven times greater in rats (21.1 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.9 x 106 vs 3.1 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.5 x 106 ; x {\{}+/-{\}} SEM, n = 10). The relative inefficiency of the human testis was uniformly expressed in cranial, equatorial and caudal regions. Furthermore, DSP/g was highly correlated between paired testes from individual men (r = +0.97, n = 10), and differences between paired testes were not significantly different from zero (P{\textgreater}0.4). Histometric analysis of glutaraldehyde-perfused testes revealed differences (P{\textless}0.05) in relative testicular compositions between humans and rats (n = 3) including higher proportions of parenchyma, seminiferous tubules, seminiferous epithelium and germinal cells in the rat testis. Humans exceeded rats only in the proportions of testis occupied by nongerminal components such as tunic, interstitium, tubule boundary tissue and Sertoli cells. Histometric determination of the proportion of the testicular parenchyma occupied by these nuclei and consideration of average volume of round spermatid nuclei yielded DSP/g estimates of 17.4 {\{}+/-{\}} 1.8 x 106 in rats (not significantly different from the result by the homogenization method) and 8.5 {\{}+/-{\}} 1.3 x 106 in humans (almost three times higher than the value obtained by the homogenization method). Although the disparity between values for human DSP/g obtained by the two methods cannot yet be explained, several lines of evidence suggest that the time divisor used for human material processed by the homogenization method is too long, thus yielding an underestimation of daily sperm production. While its absolute accuracy is questionable, the homogenization method remains a rapid and precise technique for estimating DSP/g in humans. Histometric analysis and histometric estimation of DSP/g support the concept that the human is less efficient in sperm production than the rat, but these methods suggest that the rat is only about twice as efficient per gram of testicular parenchyma as the human.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The primary function of the mammalian testis is the production of both gametes and hormones over a reproductive lifespan. This production of gametes proceeds in the seminiferous tubules and is supported by a stem cell population, the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Like other tissue-specific stem cells, SSCs are defined by their ability to balance between self-renewal and differentiation. This balance maintains the stem cell pool and guarantees the daily production of spermatozoa from puberty onward. Studying SSCs is difficult because they are very few in number (0.03{\%} of all germ cells), and specific markers have not been identified so far. Most of our knowledge results from experiments in rodent models. Very little is known about human SSCs. This review provides an update on SSCs, on their role in male fertility, and on (future) clinical applications using these fascinating cells.},

Many of the changes are associated with the acquisition of the capacity to support post-fertilization development. Our knowledge of this aspect has greatly increased- for example, insights into how the re-establishment of parental imprints is regulated. In addition, an emerging theme from recent studies is that epigenetic modifiers have key roles in germ-cell development itself--for example, epigenetics contributes to the gene-expression programme that is required for germ-cell development, regulation of meiosis and genomic integrity. Understanding epigenetic regulation in germ cells has implications for reproductive engineering technologies and human health.},

abstract = {Proacrosin biosynthesis timing during human spermatogenesis has been studied using the monoclonal antibody 4D4 (mAb 4D4). Frozen and paraffin-embedded sections of testicular biopsies were labelled by standard indirect immunofluorescence and avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase procedures. The labelling specificity was checked by immunochemistry assays on unrelated tissues and by western blotting of testis extracts showing that only the 50-55 x 10(3) Mr proacrosin was recognized by mAb 4D4. Proacrosin was first observed in the Golgi region of midpachytene primary spermatocytes. In late pachytene primary spermatocytes, proacrosin was observed in two regions located at opposite nuclear poles. During the subsequent steps of the first meiotic division, the two bodies containing proacrosin were located: (i) on opposite sides of the equatorial plate during metaphase; (ii) along the microtubular spindle during anaphase; and (iii) close to each chromosomal aggregate during telophase. Two bodies containing proacrosin were still observed in interphasic secondary spermatocytes. The single labelled area observed in early spermatids was found to increase considerably in size during spermiogenesis. Anomalies of proacrosin scattering were observed in patients with Golgi complex partitioning failure. These data reveal proacrosin biosynthesis during diploid and haploid phases of human spermatogenesis and the proacrosin partitioning pattern during meiosis.},

abstract = {The physiological function of spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and mammals is to produce spermatozoa (1n, haploid) that contain only half of the genetic material of spermatogonia (2n, diploid). This half number of chromosomes from a spermatozoon will then be reconstituted to become a diploid cell upon fertilization with an egg, which is also haploid. Thus, genetic information from two parental individuals can be passed onto their offspring. Spermatogenesis takes place in the seminiferous epithelium of the seminiferous tubule, the functional unit of the mammalian testis. In mammals, particularly in rodents, the fascinating morphological changes that occur during spermatogenesis involving cellular differentiation and transformation, mitosis, meiosis, germ cell movement, spermiogenesis and spermiation have been well documented from the 1950s through the 1980s. During this time, however, the regulation of, as well as the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse cellular events occurring throughout spermatogenesis, have remained largely unexplored. In the past two decades, important advancements have been made using new biochemical, cell and molecular biology techniques to understand how different genes, proteins and signalling pathways regulate various aspects of spermatogenesis. These include studies on the differentiation of spermatogonia from gonocytes; regulation of spermatogonial stem cells; regulation of spermatogonial mitosis; regulation of meiosis, spermiogenesis and spermiation; role of hormones (e.g. oestrogens, androgens) in spermatogenesis; transcriptional regulation of spermatogenesis; regulation of apoptosis; cell-cell interactions; and the biology of junction dynamics during spermatogenesis. The impact of environmental toxicants on spermatogenesis has also become an urgent issue in the field in light of declining fertility levels in males. Many of these studies have helped investigators to understand important similarities, differences and evolutionary relationships between C. elegans, D. melanogaster and mammals relating to spermatogenesis. In this Special Issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, we have covered many of these areas, and in this Introduction, we highlight the topic of spermatogenesis by examining its past, present and future.},

abstract = {Testicular biopsies were obtained at various intervals after intra-testicular injections of tritiated thymidine. Radioautographs revealed that the most mature labeled germ cells were the preleptotene spermatocytes at 1 hour, the midpachytene spermatocytes at 16 days, and the immature spermatids at 32 days after injection. These results indicated that one cycle of the seminiferous epithelium lasts 16 days, and the whole of spermatogenesis is estimated to con-sume approximately 64 days. In sharp contrast to other mammalian species, the arrangement of germ cells in the human seminiferous epithelium appears to be and always has been con-sidered chaotic. No clearcut cellular association could, until recently, be identified and the "cycle of the semi-niferous epithelium" in man was said to be nonexistent. This lack of organi-zation would obviously hinder any eval-uation of the rate of development of the germinal elements. Recently Cler-mont (1) determined the composition of six typical cellular associations and described the cyclic evolution of the seminiferous epithelium in man. These findings were confirmed and applied to studies on the effects of diamines on human spermatogenesis (2). These cellular relations have been used in the present investigation to obtain an esti-mate of the duration of spermatogenesis. In a few mammals, spermatogenesis, the process by which spermatogonial stem cells proliferate and transform into spermatozoa, has been accurately timed by labeling resting (also called pre-leptotene) spermatocytes with a DNA precursor and radioautographing sec-tions of testis at various time intervals},

abstract = {In testicular imprint smears from 100 infertile men (both testicles), stained using the Pappenheim and Papanicolaou methods, the cell forms (light and dark spermatogonia, primary and secondary spermatocytes, spermatids, spermatozoa and Sertoli cells) were identified and quantified by the counting of 500 consecutive cells. Identification of the cell types, which are described and illustrated, was consistent and reproducible; the advantages of the different stainings in their analysis is documented. The cell counts were tested for reproducibility and compared to the histologic diagnoses and sperm counts. Statistical analysis showed the highest reproducibility for cells frequently encountered in smears (0.99 for Sertoli cells and 0.98 for spermatozoa) and the lowest but still satisfactory reproducibility for rare or arbitrarily defined cell forms (0.71 for dark spermatogonia and 0.76 for secondary spermatocytes). The high reproducibility of the smear quantification permits the introduction of a number of indices, defining clinically useful relations between cell types that are indicative of various types of infertility. The data obtained by cytologic quantification showed reasonably good correlation with the histologic diagnoses of desquamation and focal fibrosis and excellent correlation with Sertoli cells only, arrested spermatogenesis and complete fibrosis. The cytologic quantification of testicular smears adds considerable information to the diagnosis of impaired fertility and should be instituted in properly equipped centers.},

However, injection of spermatids alone seldom activates eggs in the mouse, as spermatids by themselves cannot induce an increase in intracellular Ca2+, a prerequisite for egg activation. We injected a mouse round spermatid into an egg simultaneously with partially purified sperm factor from differentiated hamster spermatozoa. The combined injection produced repetitive Ca2+ increases (Ca2+ oscillations) lasting for at least 4 h as observed at fertilization, and induced activation in 92{\%} of eggs. This method provided 75{\%} fertilization success associated with male and female pronucleus formation and development to 2-cell embryos, while only 7{\%} of eggs were fertilized by injection of a spermatid alone. Of the 2-cell embryos, approximately 50{\%} developed to blastocysts during 5 days of culture in vitro, while no blastocysts were obtained following injection of sperm factor alone. Furthermore, the 2-cell embryos, that were created by spermatids and sperm factor and transplanted into foster mothers, developed into normal offspring, although the percentage was only 22{\%}. All infants grew into healthy adults carrying normal chromosomes. The sperm factor served as a complementary factor for successful fertilization by round spermatid injection.},

abstract = {Genomic imprinting occurs in both male and female gametes during gametogenesis, but the exact time when imprinting begins and ends is unknown. In the present study we injected nuclei of testicular spermatozoa and round spermatids into mature mouse oocytes to see whether these nuclei are able to participate in syngamy and normal embryonic development. If the injected oocytes develop into normal fertile offspring, imprinting in the male germ cells used must have been completed by the time of injection. Ninety-two percent of mouse oocytes injected with testicular spermatozoa survived and 94{\%} of these were fertilized normally (extrusion of the second polar body and formation of male and female pronuclei). When 44 two-cell embryos so created were transferred to 5 foster mothers, 24 (54.5{\%}) developed into normal offspring. Unlike testicular spermatozoa, round spermatids could not activate the oocytes, and therefore the oocytes had to be activated artificially either before or after spermatid injection. The highest rate (77{\%}) of normal fertilization was obtained when the oocytes were first activated by electric current, then injected individually with a single spermatid nucleus. When 131 two-cell embryos were transferred to 15 foster mothers, 37 (28.2{\%}) reached full term. All but two grew into healthy adults. Thus, it would appear that gametic imprinting in mouse spermatogenic cells is completed before spermiogenesis begins. Under the experimental conditions employed, spermatid nuclei were less efficient than testicular sperm nuclei in producing normal offspring, but perhaps this was due to technical rather than inherent problems.},

abstract = {Spermiogenesis constitutes the steps involved in the metamorphosis of spermatids into spermatozoa. It involves modification of several organelles in addition to the formation of several structures including the flagellum and cytoplasmic droplet. The flagellum is composed of a neck region and middle, principal, and end pieces. The axoneme composed of nine outer microtubular doublets circularly arranged to form a cylinder around a central pair of microtubules is present throughout the flagellum. The middle and principal pieces each contain specific components such as the mitochondrial sheath and fibrous sheath, respectively, while outer dense fibers are common to both. A plethora of proteins are constituents of each of these structures, with each playing key roles in functions related to the fertility of spermatozoa. At the end of spermiogenesis, a portion of spermatid cytoplasm remains associated with the released spermatozoa, referred to as the cytoplasmic droplet. The latter has as its main feature Golgi saccules, which appear to modify the plasma membrane of spermatozoa as they move down the epididymal duct and hence may be partly involved in male gamete maturation. The end product of spermatogenesis is highly streamlined and motile spermatozoa having a condensed nucleus equipped with an acrosome. Spermatozoa move through the female reproductive tract and eventually penetrate the zona pellucida and bind to the egg plasma membrane. Many proteins have been implicated in the process of fertilization as well as a plethora of proteins involved in the development of spermatids and sperm, and these are high lighted in this review.},

Many mammals have one protamine, but a few species, including humans and mice, have two. Here we use gene targeting to determine if the second protamine provides redundancy to an essential process, or if both protamines are necessary. We disrupted the coding sequence of one allele of either Prm1 or Prm2 in embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from 129-strain mice, and injected them into blastocysts from C57BL/6-strain mice. Male chimeras produced 129-genotype sperm with disrupted Prm1 or Prm2 alleles, but failed to sire offspring carrying the 129 genome. We also found that a decrease in the amount of either protamine disrupts nuclear formation, processing of protamine-2 and normal sperm function. Our studies show that both protamines are essential and that haploinsufficiency caused by a mutation in one allele of Prm1 or Prm2 prevents genetic transmission of both mutant and wild-type alleles.},

Recent studies have revealed the molecular structures and functions of a number of axonemal components, including the motor molecules, the dyneins, and regulatory substructures, such as radial spoke, central pair, and other accessory structures. The force for flagellar movement is exerted by the sliding of outer-doublet microtubules driven by the molecular motors, the dyneins. Dynein activity is regulated by the radial spoke/central pair apparatus through protein phosphorylation, resulting in flagellar bend propagation. Prior to fertilization, sperm exhibit dramatic motility changes, such as initiation and activation of motility and chemotaxis toward the egg. These changes are triggered by changes in the extracellular ionic environment and substances released from the female reproductive tract or egg. After reception of these extracellular signa...},

abstract = {The details of a new fixation procedure using 40 per cent osmium tetroxide in carbon tetrachloride are presented. This fixative is a good general preservative, gives a higher contrast than the ordinary osmium fixatives, and may also preserve structures that are not otherwise readily revealed. Some possible reasons for the increased contrast are discussed. Micrographs of the sea urchin spermatozoa treated with the new fixative provide more detailed information on the tail structure than has heretofore been obtainable. This information is summarized in the diagrammatic text-figure. The sperm tail can no longer be regarded as having a bilateral symmetry, and thus, it is possible to assign an index number to each of the nine peripheral filaments. The nine peripheral filaments have a complex morphology, each one of them seems to be composed of two subunits that have unequal diameters. The slightly larger subunits are all found in the clockwise direction with regard to the other subunit or are all found in the counter-clockwise direction in the sectioned tail. Each of the slightly larger subunits is at intervals provided with two types of projections-referred to as the arms and the spokes-that extend in respective tangential and radial direction. The arms from one filament may be in actual contact with its neighboring filament through a complex bridge-like formation. There is a quantitative difference between the nine filaments with regard to this bridge. It is assumed that the eleven tail filaments follow straight paths. Some hypotheses on sperm movement are discussed based on this assumption and on the fact that the oscillations of an actively working sperm tail are in one plane. Probably, the nine peripheral filaments have non-equivalent functions in tail movement. In the centriole the nine peripheral filaments characteristically appear as triplets in a whorl-like arrangement. It is suggested that the inner part of this triplet is a derivation of the arms. A structural abnormality of the tail is described that is characterized by two or three complete sets of tail filaments within one cell membrane.},

It begins anteriorly at the annulus, is composed of two longitudinal columns connected by circumferential ribs, and surrounds the outer dense fibers in the principal piece. The formation of the FS was described eloquently nearly twenty-five years ago, but the identification of its components has occurred only during the last few years. Most of the genes encoding the known FS components are expressed during the postmeiotic period of spermatogenesis, are expressed only in spermatogenic cells, and are either novel genes or paralogues of genes expressed in somatic cells. The proteins of the FS can be classified in nine categories based on their functional or structural roles. Most of these are resistant to solubilization and remain in the FS during rigorous isolation procedures. Mouse sperm with a knock out of the gene encoding GAPDHS are immotile, which demonstrates that most of the ATP needed for sperm motility is generated by glycolysis. Most of the glycolytic enzymes have been localised to the principal piece and some are tightly associated with the FS. However, the nature of the protein-protein interactions involved in assembly and maintenance of FS are known for only a few of the component proteins.},

Histone retention and modification, protamine incorporation into the chromatin, DNA methylation, and spermatozoal RNA transcripts appear to play important roles in the epigenetic state of mature sperm. These epigenetic factors may reveal a historical record of spermatogenesis, portend future functions in embryogenesis, and help to elucidate mechanism of pluripotency. In contrast to the once held dogma regarding the importance of the paternal epigenome, the unique epigenetic landscape in sperm appears to serve more than the gamete itself and is likely influential in the developing embryo. In fact, growing evidence suggests that mature sperm provide appropriate epigenetic marks that drive specific genes toward activation and contribute to the pluripotent state of the embryonic cells. Although not definitive, the current literature provides evidence for the role of the sperm epigenome in the embryo. Future work must be focused on the characterization of epigenetic abnormalities commonly found in individuals with compromised fertility to further establish this role. Additionally, studies should target the effects of environment and aging on the sperm epigenetic program and subsequent fertility loss to determine the etiology of aberrant epigenetic profiles.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To review and summarize the current understanding of the epigenetic status of human sperm in regards to protamination, specific localization and modifications of retained histones, and DNA methylation. DESIGN Review of the relevant literature. SETTING University-based clinical and research laboratories. PATIENT(S) Fertile and infertile men. INTERVENTION(S) None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Critical review of the literature. RESULT(S) Sperm from normospermic, fertile men have epigenetic modifications consistent with gene "poising" at the promoters of genes involved in development, including the localization of retained histones with bivalent histone modifications and hypomethylation of DNA. These epigenetic marks are altered in some patients with abnormal spermatogenesis, and in some men who exhibit unexplained, altered embryogenesis during IVF therapy. CONCLUSION(S) The sperm epigenome implies a poising of the paternal genome for embryogenesis and a possible role in the establishment of totipotency of the embryo and may help in understanding some causes of reduced fertility and transmission of disease risk.},

abstract = {Autoradiographic procedures for the study of RNA and protein synthesis during spermatogenesis have been complemented with electron microscope techniques for visualization of gene activity. These procedures have enabled us to determine that RNA transcription is highly selective with respect to RNA species, timing of synthesis, types of chromosomes (autosomes and sex chromosomes), segments of chromosomes (i.e., the lampbrush segment), and chromatin structure. In mouse and human spermatocytes, a peak production of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) occurs during leptotene-zygotene, preceding nonnucleolar RNA synthesis, which is at a peak in middle pachytene. Transcription in late spermatids decreases in coincidence with changes in chromatin structure and high incorporation rates of [3H]arginine. In these cells, a particulate repeating pattern of chromatin is replaced by chromatin fibers of uniform diameter as highly arginine-rich proteins replace somatic histones. In spermatogonia, spermatocytes and Sertoli cells, the products of transcription are mainly heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) and rRNA, whereas spermatids transcribe predominantly hnRNA during early spermiogenesis. Persistent long-lived [3H]-uridine-labeled RNA species in pachytene spermatocyte nuclei contrast with a fast turnover of [3H]uridine-labeled RNA in Sertoli cells as detected at the same pulse labeling time (8--12 days). From these results one can postulate a still undefined control mechanism of gene expression during spermatogenesis for modulating a cascade of events required for male gamete formation.},

abstract = {The tertiary structure of the DNA that makes up the eukaryotic genome is remarkably plastic, taking many different forms in response to the different needs of the cell. During the cell cycle of one cell, the DNA is replicated, reorganized into mitotic chromosomes, and decondensed into interphase chromatin. Within one cell at any given point in time, the chromatin is divided into hetero- and euchromatin reflecting active and inactive states of the DNA. This organization varies within one organism since different parts of the genome are active in different cell types. This article focuses on the most dramatic cell-type-specific DNA organization, that found in spermatozoa, in which the entire genome is reorganized into an inactive state that is more highly condensed than mitotic chromosomes. This unique example of eukaryotic DNA organization offers some interesting clues to the still unanswered questions about the role that the three-dimensional packaging of DNA plays in its function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND RNA-Seq has become increasingly popular in transcriptome profiling. One aspect of transcriptome research is to quantify the expression levels of genomic elements, such as genes, their transcripts and exons. Acquiring a transcriptome expression profile requires genomic elements to be defined in the context of the genome. Multiple human genome annotation databases exist, including RefGene (RefSeq Gene), Ensembl, and the UCSC annotation database. The impact of the choice of an annotation on estimating gene expression remains insufficiently investigated. RESULTS In this paper, we systematically characterized the impact of genome annotation choice on read mapping and transcriptome quantification by analyzing a RNA-Seq dataset generated by the Human Body Map 2.0 Project. The impact of a gene model on mapping of non-junction reads is different from junction reads. For the RNA-Seq dataset with a read length of 75 bp, on average, 95{\%} of non-junction reads were mapped to exactly the same genomic location regardless of which gene models was used. By contrast, this percentage dropped to 53{\%} for junction reads. In addition, about 30{\%} of junction reads failed to align without the assistance of a gene model, while 10-15{\%} mapped alternatively. There are 21,958 common genes among RefGene, Ensembl, and UCSC annotations. When we compared the gene quantification results in RefGene and Ensembl annotations, 20{\%} of genes are not expressed, and thus have a zero count in both annotations. Surprisingly, identical gene quantification results were obtained for only 16.3{\%} (about one sixth) of genes. Approximately 28.1{\%} of genes' expression levels differed by 5{\%} or higher, and of those, the relative expression levels for 9.3{\%} of genes (equivalent to 2038) differed by 50{\%} or greater. The case studies revealed that the gene definition differences in gene models frequently result in inconsistency in gene quantification. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that the choice of a gene model has a dramatic effect on both gene quantification and differential analysis. Our research will help RNA-Seq data analysts to make an informed choice of gene model in practical RNA-Seq data analysis.},

@article{McCarthy2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Variant annotation is a crucial step in the analysis of genome sequencing data. Functional annotation results can have a strong influence on the ultimate conclusions of disease studies. Incorrect or incomplete annotations can cause researchers both to overlook potentially disease-relevant DNA variants and to dilute interesting variants in a pool of false positives. Researchers are aware of these issues in general, but the extent of the dependency of final results on the choice of transcripts and software used for annotation has not been quantified in detail. METHODS This paper quantifies the extent of differences in annotation of 80 million variants from a whole-genome sequencing study. We compare results using the RefSeq and Ensembl transcript sets as the basis for variant annotation with the software Annovar, and also compare the results from two annotation software packages, Annovar and VEP (Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor), when using Ensembl transcripts. RESULTS We found only 44{\%} agreement in annotations for putative loss-of-function variants when using the RefSeq and Ensembl transcript sets as the basis for annotation with Annovar. The rate of matching annotations for loss-of-function and nonsynonymous variants combined was 79{\%} and for all exonic variants it was 83{\%}. When comparing results from Annovar and VEP using Ensembl transcripts, matching annotations were seen for only 65{\%} of loss-of-function variants and 87{\%} of all exonic variants, with splicing variants revealed as the category with the greatest discrepancy. Using these comparisons, we characterised the types of apparent errors made by Annovar and VEP and discuss their impact on the analysis of DNA variants in genome sequencing studies. CONCLUSIONS Variant annotation is not yet a solved problem. Choice of transcript set can have a large effect on the ultimate variant annotations obtained in a whole-genome sequencing study. Choice of annotation software can also have a substantial effect. The annotation step in the analysis of a genome sequencing study must therefore be considered carefully, and a conscious choice made as to which transcript set and software are used for annotation.},

Multiple software tools for variant calling are available, but it is unclear how comparable these tools are or what their relative merits in real-world scenarios might be. We sequenced 15 exomes from four families using commercial kits (Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and Agilent SureSelect version 2 capture kit), with approximately 120X mean coverage. We analyzed the raw data using near-default parameters with five different alignment and variant-calling pipelines (SOAP, BWA-GATK, BWA-SNVer, GNUMAP, and BWA-SAMtools). We additionally sequenced a single whole genome using the sequencing and analysis pipeline from Complete Genomics (CG), with 95{\%} of the exome region being covered by 20 or more reads per base. Finally, we validated 919 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 841 insertions and deletions (indels), including similar fractions of GATK-only, SOAP-only, and shared calls, on the MiSeq platform by amplicon sequencing with approximately 5000X mean coverage. SNV concordance between five Illumina pipelines across all 15 exomes was 57.4{\%}, while 0.5 to 5.1{\%} of variants were called as unique to each pipeline. Indel concordance was only 26.8{\%} between three indel-calling pipelines, even after left-normalizing and intervalizing genomic coordinates by 20 base pairs. There were 11{\%} of CG variants falling within targeted regions in exome sequencing that were not called by any of the Illumina-based exome analysis pipelines. Based on targeted amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform, 97.1{\%}, 60.2{\%}, and 99.1{\%} of the GATK-only, SOAP-only and shared SNVs could be validated, but only 54.0{\%}, 44.6{\%}, and 78.1{\%} of the GATK-only, SOAP-only and shared indels could be validated. Additionally, our analysis of two families (one with four individuals and the other with seven), demonstrated additional accuracy gained in variant discovery by having access to genetic data from a multi-generational family. Our results suggest that more caution should be exercised in genomic medicine settings when analyzing individual genomes, including interpreting positive and negative findings with scrutiny, especially for indels. We advocate for renewed collection and sequencing of multi-generational families to increase the overall accuracy of whole genomes.},

abstract = {Largely because of efforts required to complete the Human Genome Project, DNA sequencing has undergone a steady transformation with still-ongoing developments of high-throughput sequencing machines for which the cost per reaction is falling drastically. Similarly, the fast-changing landscape of reproductive technologies has been improved by genetic approaches. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis and screening were established more than two decades ago for selecting genetically normal embryos to avoid inherited diseases and to give the highest potential to achieve stable pregnancies. Most recent additions to the IVF practices (blastocyst/trophectoderm biopsy, embryo vitrification) and adoption of new genetics tools such as array comparative genome hybridization have allowed setting up more precise and efficient programs for clinical embryo diagnosis. Nevertheless, there is always room for improvements. Remarkably, a recent explosion in the release of advanced sequencing benchtop platforms, together with a certain maturity of bioinformatics tools, has set the target goal of sequencing individual cells for embryo diagnosis to be a realistically feasible scenario for the near future. Next-generation sequencing technology should provide the opportunity to simultaneously analyze single-gene disorders and perform an extensive comprehensive chromosome screening/diagnosis by concurrently sequencing, counting, and accurately assembling millions of DNA reads.

There have been many clear successes in identifying genes that are responsible for Mendelian diseases, and sequencing approaches are now poised to identify the mutations that cause undiagnosed childhood genetic diseases and those that predispose individuals to more common complex diseases. There are, however, growing concerns that the complexity and magnitude of complete sequence data could lead to an explosion of weakly justified claims of association between genetic variants and disease. Here, we provide an overview of the basic workflow in next-generation sequencing studies and emphasize, where possible, measures and considerations that facilitate accurate inferences from human sequencing studies.},

The growing collection of publicly available reference genome sequences will underpin a new era of whole genome re-sequencing, but sequencing costs need to fall and throughput needs to rise by several orders of magnitude. Novel technologies are being developed to meet this need by generating massive amounts of sequence that can be aligned to the reference sequence. The challenge is to maintain the high standards of accuracy and completeness that are hallmarks of the previous genome projects.

Although 88.1{\%} of the ∼3.7 million unique SNVs were concordant between platforms, there were tens of thousands of platform-specific calls located in genes and other genomic regions. In contrast, 26.5{\%} of indels were concordant between platforms.

abstract = {Significance: The colonization of wounds by specific microbes or communities of microbes may delay healing and/or lead to infection-related complication. Studies of wound-associated microbial communities (microbiomes) to date have primarily relied upon culture-based methods, which are known to have extreme biases and are not reliable for the characterization of microbiomes. Biofilms are very resistant to culture and are therefore especially difficult to study with techniques that remain standard in clinical settings. Recent Advances: Culture-independent approaches employing next-generation DNA sequencing have provided researchers and clinicians a window into wound-associated microbiomes that could not be achieved before and has begun to transform our view of wound-associated biodiversity. Within the past decade, many platforms have arisen for performing this type of sequencing, with various types of applications for microbiome research being possible on each. Critical Issues: Wound care incorporating knowledge of microbiomes gained from next-generation sequencing could guide clinical management and treatments. The purpose of this review is to outline the current platforms, their applications, and the steps necessary to undertake microbiome studies using next-generation sequencing. Future Directions: As DNA sequencing technology progresses, platforms will continue to produce longer reads and more reads per run at lower costs. A major future challenge is to implement these technologies in clinical settings for more precise and rapid identification of wound bioburden.},

Although multiple public resources provide annotation, different methods are used that can result in similar but not identical representation of genes, transcripts, and proteins. The collaborative consensus coding sequence (CCDS) project tracks identical protein annotations on the reference mouse and human genomes with a stable identifier (CCDS ID), and ensures that they are consistently represented on the NCBI, Ensembl, and UCSC Genome Browsers. Importantly, the project coordinates on manually reviewing inconsistent protein annotations between sites, as well as annotations for which new evidence suggests a revision is needed, to progressively converge on a complete protein-coding set for the human and mouse reference genomes, while maintaining a high standard of reliability and biological accuracy. To date, the project has identified 20,159 human and 17,707 mouse consensus coding regions from 17,052 human and 16,893 mouse genes. Three evaluation methods indicate that the entries in the CCDS set are highly likely to represent real proteins, more so than annotations from contributing groups not included in CCDS. The CCDS database thus centralizes the function of identifying well-supported, identically-annotated, protein-coding regions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in human genomics have allowed unprecedented productivity in terms of algorithms, software, and literature available for translating raw next-generation sequence data into high-quality information. The challenges of variant identification in organisms with lower quality reference genomes are less well documented. We explored the consequences of commonly recommended preparatory steps and the effects of single and multi sample variant identification methods using four publicly available software applications (Platypus, HaplotypeCaller, Samtools and UnifiedGenotyper) on whole genome sequence data of 65 key ancestors of Swiss dairy cattle populations. Accuracy of calling next-generation sequence variants was assessed by comparison to the same loci from medium and high-density single nucleotide variant (SNV) arrays.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: The total number of SNVs identified varied by software and method, with single (multi) sample results ranging from 17.7 to 22.0 (16.9 to 22.0) million variants. Computing time varied considerably between software. Preparatory realignment of insertions and deletions and subsequent base quality score recalibration had only minor effects on the number and quality of SNVs identified by different software, but increased computing time considerably. Average concordance for single (multi) sample results with high-density chip data was 58.3{\{}{\%}{\}} (87.0{\{}{\%}{\}}) and average genotype concordance in correctly identified SNVs was 99.2{\{}{\%}{\}} (99.2{\{}{\%}{\}}) across software. The average quality of SNVs identified, measured as the ratio of transitions to transversions, was higher using single sample methods than multi sample methods. A consensus approach using results of different software generally provided the highest variant quality in terms of transition/transversion ratio.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings serve as a reference for variant identification pipeline development in non-human organisms and help assess the implication of preparatory steps in next-generation sequencing pipelines for organisms with incomplete reference genomes (pipeline code is included). Benchmarking this information should prove particularly useful in processing next-generation sequencing data for use in genome-wide association studies and genomic selection.},

abstract = {The concept of absorptive capacity was introduced by Cohen and Levinthal in 1989. Since then it has been enhanced through reconceptualizations and extended by various empirical studies. Despite the growing interest in absorptive capacity it is unclear what this large stream of papers has collectively accomplished. The used definitions, antecedents, components and outcomes of the construct are extremely heterogeneous. Due to this heterogeneity, the empirical study of the construct remains difficult. There is no standard measure and no standard method of measurement, which can be used in empirical research. To bring more clarity into this research area, this paper provides a critical review of previous empirical treatments of absorptive capacity. For this purpose, different methods of measurement are classified in the following way: within quantitative methods proxy indicators and perceptive instruments are differentiated. Proxy indicators use single firm-level data for measuring absorptive capacity and can be input-oriented (R{\&}D efforts, R{\&}D human capital) or output-oriented (R{\&}D patents, R{\&}D publications). Perceptive instruments imply that researchers develop single questions or a set of questions, which reflect absorptive capacity or parts of it at the operational level. The main weakness of both proxy indicators and perceptive instruments is that they don't meet the complexity and emergence of the construct. Only few qualitative studies have started to adopt a new perspective, recognizing the process and practice-based character of absorptive capacity. In summary, the critical review prints out the necessity of advancing research in this area. For this reason, we set out to develop an alternative approach to capture absorptive capacity. It is a practice-oriented approach that allows studying actual absorptive practices in real world situations and enables researchers to capture the complex, embedded, and context-dependent patterns of acting.},
